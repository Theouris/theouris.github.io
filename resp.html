      <h1>Step 1 - Respiratory</h1>
      <h2 id="anatomy">Anatomy</h2>
      <p>The human respiratory tract consists of the upper respiratory tract (URT) which spans from the nasal cavity to the larynx and the lower respiratory tract (LRT) which spans from the trachea to the alveolar sacs. The trachea is a wide, flexible airway roughly 2 cm in diameter and extends from the cricoid cartilage (C6) to the sternal angle (at level T4/T5), at which the trachea bifurcates into the primary bronchi. This bifurcation is known as the Carina. Anteriorly-located hyaline cartilage rings maintain the patency of the trachea, keeping it open to facilitate proper airflow. The posterior side of the trachea is composed of fibroelastic tissue and a longitudinal (up + down) Trachealis muscle that regulates the diameter of the trachea, and therefore the amount of air that reaches the lungs.</p>

      <p>There are two lungs in the human body. The right lung consists of three lobes (upper, middle, lower) and two fissures (horizontal and oblique) that separate them. The left lung has two lobes (upper and lower) and one oblique fissure that separates the two, as well as a "lingula" that serves and a downward expansion of the upper left lobe (where the middle lobe would be on the right lung). There are three main surfaces of the lungs: the costal surface, which is the part of the lung facing the chest wall, the diaphragmatic, which is the side facing the diaphragm, and the mediastinal surface, facing inwards towards the mediastinum and the heart. This is where the hilum is.</p>

      <p>The hilum is the location on the lungs where the bronchi, pulmonary arteries, pulmonary veins, bronchial arteries, bronchial veins, nerves, and lymphatics all enter the lung. In the right lung, the pulmonary arteries are located anterior to the bronchi and in the left lung, the pulmonary arteries are located superior to the bronchi (the mnemonic RALS (Right Anterior Left Superior) can be used to remember this). The phrenic nerve runs anterior and the vagus nerve runs posterior to each hilum.</p>

      <p>The pulmonary arteries extend from the heart and obtain oxygen from the lungs. The pulmonary veins return oxygenated blood to the left side of the heart. The bronchial arteries are what mainly supply the lung tissue with oxygenated blood. There is one right bronchial artery (which extends from the 3rd posterior intercostal artery) and two left bronchial arteries (which stem from the aorta). The bronchial veins take deoxygenated blood from the lungs and drain into the pulmonary and azygos veins. The azygos vein drains directly into the superior vena cava.</p>

      <p>There are two lymphatic networks pertaining to the lungs: the superficial (subpleural) and deep (peribronchial). The intrapulmonary lymph nodes drain into the hilar nodes, which then drain into the mediastinal nodes, then the broncho-mediastinal trunks, then either the thoracic duct or the right lymphatic duct, then both into the venous angle. The right lung and left lower lobe drains into the right lymphatic duct. The left upper lobe drains into the thoracic duct. The thoracic duct is the longest lymphatic channel, which starts at T12 and ascends all the way to the left venous angle, which is the junction of the left subclavian vein and the left internal jugular vein.</p>

      </div>
      <p>The nerves that supply the lung converge into what is known as the pulmonary plexus. This plexus consists of the Vagus (parasympathetic) nerve and sympathetic fibers. The parasympathetic innervation is responsible for bronchoconstriction, increasing mucosal secretions, the cough reflex, and visceral sensations (ie. from the trachea). The sympathetic innervation is responsible for bronchodilation and visceral sensations from the bronchi and the visceral pleura. While the visceral pleura does not have nerves that send afferent pain signals, the parietal pleura does.</p>

      <p>The parietal pleura lines the thoracic wall, the diaphragm, and the mediastinum. It is innervated by the intercostal nerves and the phrenic nerve. The visceral pleura lines the lungs themselves. The pleural cavity refers to the space between the two, and is filled with serous pleural fluid. Expansion of the chest wall creates a vacuum effect that is further exacerbated by the surface tension of the pleural fluid, which allows the lungs to expand even though they are not directly attached to the chest wall. The costodiaphragmatic recess lies between the costal and diaphragmatic pleura, and is a typical location of fluid accumulation.</p>

      <p>The diaphragm is the primary muscle of inspiration. It is supplied by the phrenic nerve (C3,4,5 keeps the diaphragm alive) and its blood supply primarily comes from the inferior and superior phrenic arteries. Because of its nerve's origin from C3-5, irritation of the nerve can refer to pain in the C3-5 dermatomes located at the shoulder. Further damage to the phrenic nerve can result in ipsilateral diaphragmatic paralysis.</p>
      <p>The Main Bronchi, also known as the primary bronchi, consists of two airways (one right, one left) that then split into lobar bronchi. The right main bronchus is wider and shorter than the left, and is more likely to be the site of obstruction during aspiration. The left main bronchus is narrower and longer, due to the presence of the heart on the left side of the body. The lobar bronchi each supply a lobe of the lung. There are three right lobar bronchi, and two left lobar bronchi. These lobar bronchi then divide into tertiary (segmental) bronchi. The tertiary bronchi each individually supply a bronchopulmonary segment. There are 10 bronchopulmonary segments in the right lung, and 8-10 segments in the left. A bronchopulmonary segment consists of the pulmonary arteries and bronchial arteries that supply the segment, as well as all of the respiratory structures (from the segmental bronchus to the alveoli) within the segment. The pulmonary veins run in the intersegmental space between each bronchopulmonary segment.</p>

      <p>In the upper lobe of the right lung, there are three segments: apical, posterior, and anterior. The middle lobe of the right lung consists of the lateral and medial segments. The lower lobe of the right lung consists of five segments: superior, cardiac (medial basal), anterior basal, lateral basal, and posterior basal (which can be remembered with the mnemonic 'SCALP'). The upper lobe of the left lung has 5 segments, with two being in the Lingula of the left upper lobe. They are: apical, posterior, anterior, superior lingular, and inferior lingular. Just like the right lower lobe, the left lower lobe has the same 5 segments: superior, cardiac (medial basal), anterior basal, lateral basal, and posterior basal. As previously mentioned, aspiration typically occurs in the right side of the lungs due to the wider bronchus. While upright, aspiration of a foreign body typically presents in the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe. While supine, typical presentation is in the superior segment of the right lower lobe. While lying on the right side, typical presentations are in the right middle lobe or posterior segment of the right upper lobe.</p>

      <p>The bronchioles come after the tertiary bronchi, and do not contain cartilage. Instead they have abundant smooth muscle and branch into terminal bronchioles, which are smaller in size, and then respiratory bronchioles, which partially contain alveoli (the sac-like clusters of cells responsible for gas exchange in the lungs). The respiratory bronchioles then extend into alveolar ducts, then the alveoli.</p>

      <h2 id="histology">Histology</h2>
      <p>The respiratory system is divided into an upper and lower respiratory tract based on where the trachea begins. It also has a functional division into conducting and respiratory portions. The conducting portion spans from the nose to the terminal bronchioles, and the respiratory portion includes the respiratory bronchioles, the alveolar ducts, and the alveoli. The purpose of the conducting portion is to regulate, filter, warm, and humidify the flow of air to the respiratory zone, where gas exchange between outside air and the alveolar cells can occur. Visible histological differences can be observed between these two zones.</p>

      <p>Within the conducting zone of the respiratory tract, there are 4 general layers: the mucosa, the submucosa, muscle and/or cartilage, and the adventitia. The mucosa consists primarily of pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium, also known as respiratory epithelium. The mucosa also contains goblet cells which produce and secrete mucus, basal cells (progenitor cells, i.e. they create new cells) and brush cells to detect irritants within the tract. A thick basement membrane lies below the top-most layer of cells and connects it to the lamina propria, which is a collection of loose, highly vascular connective tissue that lies below. The lamina propria segways the mucosa into the submucosa, which is a layer of connective tissue containing seromucous glands (cells that create both serous fluid and mucus) and mucous glands.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">

        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>Outer-more of the submucosa are the muscle and cartilage of the conducting tract. As seen on the trachea, C-rings of hyaline cartilage line the anterior portion of the structure. The trachealis muscle bridges the ends of the C-rings. The outermost layer of the trachea is the adventitia, which is composed of dense connective tissue and anchors the trachea in place. The adventitia contains blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves.</p>

      <p>The bronchi are histologically similar to the trachea, with a few key differences. They exhibit a decrease in diameter and a decreased amount of goblet cells, seromucous glands, and cartilage (which transition from large C-rings in the trachea to cartilage plates in the bronchi). Relatively, more smooth muscle is visible surrounding the bronchi. The epithelial layer transitions from respiratory epithelium to simple ciliated columnar epithelium. As the bronchi turn into bronchioles, these changes become even more apparent.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">

      </div>
      <p>The bronchioles are roughly 1 mm in diameter and change as they transition from bronchioles, to terminal bronchioles, then to respiratory bronchioles. The simple ciliated columnar epithelium transitions to simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium as the bronchiole gets smaller. The bronchioles also have no seromucous glands, no cartilage, very few goblet cells, and increasingly prominent smooth muscle. They also have a unique type of cell called a Club (Clara) cell that secretes a surfactant-like solution and has CYP450 enzymes that detoxify the bronchioles. As bronchioles progress into terminal bronchioles, the simple cuboidal epithelium becomes composed primarily of Club cells, and no goblet cells remain. The layer of smooth muscle also diminishes in width.</p>

      </div>
      <p>As the terminal bronchioles transition into respiratory bronchioles, the number of Club cells decreases and the walls of the respiratory bronchiole begin to contain intermittent alveoli. As the respiratory tract progresses deeper, the respiratory bronchioles become alveolar ducts.</p>

      <p>The alveolar ducts are composed of alveoli and have minimal connective tissue for support. They lead into the alveolar sacs, which are clusters of alveoli that share common openings. Alveoli themselves are primarily composed of simple squamous epithelium and are the fundamental units of gas exchange. The simple squamous cells (Type I pneumocytes) lie adjacent to endothelial cells of capillaries, allowing gas exchange to occur. A fused basal lamina connects these two cell types together to ensure rapid gas exchange. Pores of Kohn connect pneumocytes together and equalize pressure between the alveoli, enabling collateral ventilation when small airways are blocked.</p>

          <figcaption>Note the alveolar-endothelial fused membranes</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>As previously mentioned, the alveoli are primarily composed of type I pneumocytes (they make up about 95% of alveoli). Type II pneumocytes are simple cuboidal epithelium, and are not as common but are very important for function. They are responsible for producing surfactant and for being progenitor cells to make new Type I + II pneumocytes. Alveolar macrophages also lie in the alveoli, and will phagocytose debris, RBCs, and pathogens in the lungs.</p>

      <p>The lung interstitium lies between the alveoli and the pulmonary capillaries when a direct basal lamina does not connect the two. It is composed of capillaries (for blood supply, not for gas exchange) fibroblasts, immune cells, and an extracellular matrix. Patency of the lung interstitium is directly responsible for lung compliance. The pleura of the lung is composed of a simple squamous mesothelium on thin connective tissue. These cells produce serous fluid and the elastic fibers of the pleura allow the lung to expand and contract. Inflammation of the pleura can cause pleuritis, which causes a sharp pain while breathing. Excess fluid in the pleural cavity can be due to inflammation as well, and is called pleural effusion.</p>

      <h2 id="embryology">Embryology</h2>
      <p>"Every Pulmonologist Can See Alveoli"</p>

      <p>The lungs typically begin developing during the fourth week of gestation during what is known as the Embryologic stage of development (weeks 4-7). The foregut endoderm buds out in what is known as the "lung bud" and develops into the primitive trachea. Failure of this process can lead to a tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) and esophageal atresia. A TEF results in a patent connection between the trachea and esophagus (typically the upper esophagus) with lower esophageal atresia (abnormal closure).</p>
      <div class="figure-row">

          <figcaption>Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) and esophageal atresia (Type B most common)</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>The pseudoglandular phase of lung development occurs in weeks 5-17. During this phase, the lungs develop all the way to the terminal bronchioles. Lungs are still not viable at this stage. The Canalicular phase occurs at weeks 16-25 and oversees the development of the respiratory bronchioles and alveoli. Increased vascularization of the lungs occurs, type I pneumocytes appear, and surfactant production begins (at weeks 20-22). The lungs can perform gas exchange at this stage. The saccular stage is from weeks 24-38 and sees the formation of the primitive alveoli. Capillaries establish close contact between the alveoli, and the blood-air barrier is established. Failure of this stage to fully develop results in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, in which infants do not produce enough surfactant to properly breathe.</p>

      <p>The alveolar stage is the last stage of lung development. It occurs from birth to 8 years of age. The alveoli continue to develop and multiply. The septa are able to thin further and gas exchange efficiency improves. It is important to note that the alveoli continue to grow and increase in number after birth. All in all, the five stages of lung development can be remembered with the mnemonic: "Every Pulmonologist Can See Alveoli" with E = Embryologic stage, P = Pseudoglandular, etc.</p>

      <p>The lung lies within the thoracic cavity, which has a specific embryological origin as well. The Intraembryotic Coelom (IC) appears at week 4 as a horseshoe-shaped cavity. The "cranial bend" of this structure becomes the pericardial (heart) cavity, the lateral limbs of the IC become the pleural (lung) cavities, and the caudal portion becomes the peritoneal (gut) cavity. Further development of the IC shows the rise of the pleuropericardial membranes, which rise from the lateral body wall and form the fibrous pericardium of the heart, which separates the heart from the lungs. The pleuroperitoneal membranes also arise from the body wall, and go on to form another structure called the diaphragm that separates the gut from the lungs.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">

          <figcaption>Diaphragm embryology. really simple stuff here LOL</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>As the lungs expand, the pleural cavity further develops. The visceral pleura is derived from the splanchic mesoderm, and the parietal is from the somatic mesoderm of the thoracic wall. The septum transversum begins as a structure above the heart, but then gradually moves downwards towards the bottom of the lungs to become the central tendon of the diaphragm. This is why the phrenic nerve begins at the neck, and extends all the way down, anterior to the roots of the lungs, to the diaphragm.</p>
  
      <h2 id="restrictive">Restrictive Lung Diseases</h2>
      <p>Restrictive lung diseases are characterized by an impaired ability of the lungs to expand due to reduced lung compliance. This limitation results in decreased lung volumes, particularly a reduced total lung capacity (TLC), reduced forced vital capacity (FVC), and reduced forced expiratory volume of 1 second (FEV1). Since the FEV1 and FVC are reduced somewhat proportionally, the FEV1/FVC ratio is typically normal or slightly increased (this is very characteristic of restrictive lung diseases). Restrictive disorders may be caused by intrinsic (parenchymal) lung diseases, which involve the interstitium of the lungs (some examples are: interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, and fibrosis) or by extrinsic (outside) conditions that alter respiratory mechanics (pleural disease, thoracic deformities, or respiratory muscle weakness). In both cases, the ability of the lungs to expand is notably reduced.</p>

      <p>Restrictive lung diseases exhibit too little compliance (ability to expand outwards) and too much recoil (ability to expand inwards). Since this is due to either intrinsic or extrinsic factors, one can use the DLCO, or diffusing capacity of Carbon Monoxide, to tell the difference. In intrinsic diseases (such as fibrosis) the lung interstitium is impaired, thus a decrease in DLCO will occur. Likewise, in extrinsic diseases (such as pleural effusion) the interstitium is unaffected, and thus the DLCO remains normal. To summarize, restrictive lung diseases are identified based on a normal/high FEV1/FVC ratio, and whether they are intrinsic/extrinsic is based on the DLCO.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Some high-yield restrictive lung diseases to know for Step 1 are: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), usual interstitial pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, pneumoconiosis, sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss), desquamative interstitial pneumonia, bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease, langerhans cell histiocytosis, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia.</p>
      
      <h3>Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) / Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP)</h3>
      <p>IPF is a progressive, patchy fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause that primarily affects older adults and is associated with smoking. Patients present with gradually progressive exertional dyspnea, dry cough, bibasilar "Velcro" crackles, and digital clubbing. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) show a restrictive pattern (decreased TLC, decreased FVC, normal or increased FEV1/FVC) with a decreased DLCO. There are no specific labs or Autoimmune testing for IPF. HRCT (a CT-scan) shows basilar, subpleural reticulation with honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis. Histology demonstrates patchy interstitial fibrosis with temporal heterogeneity and fibroblastic foci. "Honeycombing" and a poor steroid response are characteristic of this disease.</p>

      <h3>Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP)</h3>
      <p>NSIP is characterized by uniform interstitial inflammation and fibrosis and is commonly associated with patients who have previously-known connective tissue diseases (CTD), drugs, or HIV. Patients are often younger than those with IPF and may have systemic features of CTD. PFTs show restrictive lung disease with decreased DLCO. Autoantibodies (e.g., ANA, anti–Scl-70, anti–Jo-1) may be positive when CTD-related. HRCT reveals ground-glass opacities with fine reticulation, lower lobe predominance, and relative subpleural sparing, with less honeycombing than UIP. Histology shows temporal homogeneity. Uniform disease with CTD association and better prognosis than UIP help distinguish NSIP.</p>

      <h3>Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia (COP)</h3>
      <p>COP involves organization of intra-alveolar exudates and may be idiopathic or follow infection, drugs, or CTD. Patients present with subacute cough, dyspnea, malaise, and low-grade fever, often mimicking pneumonia that fails antibiotics. PFTs are often restrictive or mixed with decreased DLCO. Inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP) may be elevated. Imaging shows patchy, peripheral or peribronchial consolidations that may migrate. Histology demonstrates Masson bodies (polypoid plugs of granulation tissue in alveolar ducts and bronchioles). Migratory infiltrates with steroid responsiveness are key clues.</p>

      <h3>Sarcoidosis</h3>
      <p>Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease characterized by noncaseating granulomas, typically affecting young to middle-aged adults. Patients may have cough, dyspnea, erythema nodosum (red, tender nodules on shins), uveitis, fatigue, or be asymptomatic. PFTs are variable but often restrictive with decreased DLCO; obstructive or mixed patterns may occur. Labs may show an increase in ACE (nonspecific) and hypercalcemia (increase in Ca2+) due to macrophage 1α-hydroxylase activity. Bronchiolar lavage (BAL) often shows increased CD4/CD8 ratio. Imaging classically reveals bilateral symmetric hilar lymphadenopathy with interstitial infiltrates, with upper-lobe fibrosis in chronic disease. Noncaseating granulomas and bilateral lymphadenopathy with hypercalcemia are classic.</p>

      <h3>Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP)</h3>
      <p>HP is an immune-mediated reaction to inhaled organic antigens (primarily from birds or mold) that is most common in farmers and avian-enthusiasts. Acute disease causes flu-like symptoms with dyspnea hours after exposure; chronic disease causes progressive dyspnea and weight loss. PFTs typically show restriction with decreased DLCO, often with mixed/obstructive features due to small airway involvement. Serum precipitating IgG antibodies may support diagnosis; Bronchiolar lavage shows lymphocytosis (often low CD4/CD8). CT-scan demonstrates centrilobular ground-glass nodules, mosaic attenuation, air trapping, and the "head cheese" sign. Poorly formed granulomas, IgG, and bronchiolar inflammation are typical findings.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">

      <h3>Acute Eosinophilic Pneumonia (AEP)</h3>
      <p>AEP is often triggered by new smoking, vaping, drugs, or dust exposure and presents with acute febrile illness and severe hypoxemia resembling ARDS. PFTs commonly show restrictive physiology with decreased DLCO. Bronchiolar lavage reveals marked eosinophilia. Imaging shows diffuse bilateral opacities and frequent pleural effusions. Histology shows eosinophilic infiltration. Rapid onset with bronchiolar lavage eosinophilia and dramatic steroid response is characteristic.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">

      <h3>Chronic Eosinophilic Pneumonia (CEP)</h3>
      <p>CEP often occurs in patients with asthma or atopy and presents subacutely with cough, dyspnea, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. PFTs are restrictive with decreased DLCO. Labs show peripheral eosinophilia and with increased IgE. Imaging reveals peripheral consolidations. Histology shows eosinophilic infiltration of alveoli/interstitium. Asthma plus eosinophilia and peripheral infiltrates is classic.</p>
   
      <h3>Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA)</h3>
      <p>EGPA is an eosinophilic necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis occurring in patients with asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis. Patients present with asthma, neuropathy (mononeuritis multiplex, which is asymmetric random pain), and pulmonary infiltrates. PFTs are often obstructive due to asthma but may be mixed; DLCO may decrease with parenchymal involvement. Labs show eosinophilia, marked IgE, and sometimes p-ANCA/MPO positivity. Imaging shows patchy infiltrates. Histology reveals necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis with eosinophils. Asthma + eosinophilia + neuropathy is highly suggestive.</p>

      <h3>Desquamative Interstitial Pneumonia (DIP)</h3>
      <p>DIP is a smoking-related ILD characterized by accumulation of macrophages in alveoli. Patients have progressive dyspnea and cough. PFTs are restrictive or mixed with decreased DLCO. Bronchiolar lavage shows pigmented macrophages. Imaging reveals diffuse lower-lobe ground-glass opacities. Histology shows intra-alveolar macrophages with mild interstitial inflammation. Smoking association and improvement with cessation are key.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">

      <h3>Respiratory Bronchiolitis-Associated Interstitial Lung Disease (RB-ILD)</h3>
      <p>RB-ILD is a smoking-related bronchiolocentric inflammatory process. Patients have mild dyspnea and cough, often with concurrent emphysema. PFTs are obstructive or mixed with mildly decreased DLCO. Bronchiolar lavage shows pigmented macrophages. CT-Scan shows centrilobular nodules and patchy ground-glass opacities, often upper lobe predominant. Histology demonstrates pigmented macrophages in bronchioles. Upper lobe nodules in a smoker favor a diagnosis of RB-ILD.</p>
      
      <h3>Pulmonary Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (PLCH)</h3>
      <p>PLCH is when Langerhans cell-driven nodules form cysts in the lungs. Langerhans cells are originally found in bone and are star-shaped dendritic cells. Common symptoms are dyspnea, cough, and spontaneous pneumothorax. PFT is variable with decreased DLCO and bronchiolar lavage may show marked increase in CD1a+ cells. Upper lobe nodules and bizarre-shaped cysts; sparing of costophrenic angles often noted CD1a+, S-100+, CD207 (Langerin)+ cells; Birbeck granules, smoker patient, star-shaped upper-lobe cysts/nodules + pneumothorax is very distinctive of PLCH.</p>

      <h3>Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (PAP)</h3>
      <p>PAP is a rare syndrome characterized by progressive accumulation of surfactant within the alveoli, impairing gas exchange. The most common form (> 90%) is autoimmune PAP, caused by GM-CSF autoantibodies that reduce stimulation and function of alveolar macrophages, leading to defective surfactant clearance. Patients typically present in adulthood with dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, fatigue, weight loss, and sometimes cyanosis. Chest imaging classically shows ground-glass opacities with superimposed reticular densities. Diagnosis is supported by bronchoalveolar lavage and sometimes lung biopsy. First-line treatment is whole-lung lavage to remove excess surfactant. Complications include secondary infections, respiratory failure, and lung fibrosis.</p>
      
      <h3>Lymphoid Interstitial Pneumonia (LIP)</h3>
      <p>LIP is a rare interstitial lung disease characterized by diffuse lymphocytic infiltration of the alveoli and alveolar septa. It affects adults of all ages, particularly women, and is commonly associated with autoimmune disorders (e.g., Sjögren syndrome, SLE), lymphoproliferative disorders, and HIV infection. Patients typically present with cough and progressive exertional dyspnea. PFTs show a restrictive pattern with decreased diffusing capacity (DLCO). Diagnosis is based on clinical evaluation, HRCT, and sometimes biopsy; histology demonstrates diffuse alveolar and interstitial infiltration with plasma cells and lymphocytes. Recognition of an underlying autoimmune or immunodeficiency disorder is a key diagnostic clue.</p>

      <h3>Pneumoconiosis</h3>
      <p>Pneumoconioses (silicosis, CWP, asbestosis, berylliosis) result from inhalation of inorganic dust causing macrophage activation and pulmonary fibrosis. Dyspnea and cough occur in the setting of occupational exposure. PFTs usually show restriction with decreased DLCO but may be mixed in advanced disease due to airway distortion (which is due to bronchiectasis, more on that later). Imaging distribution depends on dust type (e.g., upper-lobe nodules in silicosis/coal workers/berylliosis, lower-lobe fibrosis and pleural plaques in asbestosis). Histology reveals dust-laden macrophages and fibrosis.</p>

      <h3>Silicosis</h3>
      <p>Silicosis results from inhalation of crystalline silica dust (e.g., mining, sandblasting, construction), causing macrophage dysfunction and progressive fibrosis. Patients may be asymptomatic early, but develop chronic cough, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and weight loss. PFTs may show mixed restrictive and obstructive findings and hypoxemia may occur. Imaging classically demonstrates numerous small (< 1 cm) rounded nodules predominantly in the upper lobes and eggshell calcifications of hilar lymph nodes. Progressive massive fibrosis may develop. Histology shows silicotic nodules with weakly birefringent silica particles in a central hyalinized region surrounded by concentric "onion-skin" collagen fibers. Increased TB risk and upper-lobe nodules with eggshell calcification are characteristic of silicosis.</p>
     
      <h3>Coal Workers' Pneumoconiosis (CWP)</h3>
      <p>CWP is caused by prolonged inhalation of coal dust leading to carbon-laden macrophage accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis. It may be asymptomatic early but can progress to chronic bronchitis and progressive massive fibrosis in severe disease. PFTs are typically restrictive with decreased DLCO but may be mixed in advanced stages. Imaging shows fine nodular opacities (< 1 cm) predominantly in the upper lung zones. Histologically, carbon-laden macrophages and fibrosis are seen. The occupational history (coal mining) and upper-lobe nodules progressing to massive fibrosis distinguish CWP.</p>
      
      </div>
      <h3>Asbestosis</h3>
      <p>Asbestosis results from long-term inhalation of asbestos fibers (e.g., shipyards, insulation, construction), with a long latency period (20–30 years). Patients present with progressive exertional dyspnea, nonproductive cough, basal end-inspiratory rales, and digital clubbing. PFTs show a restrictive pattern with early decreased DLCO and later decreased TLC and VC. Imaging demonstrates diffuse bilateral interstitial fibrosis predominantly in the lower lobes, often with pleural plaques, pleural thickening, and/or effusions. Biopsy may reveal asbestos (ferruginous) bodies, which are golden-brown, dumbbell-shaped rods coated with iron (found via a Prussian blue positive stain). Lower-lobe fibrosis plus pleural plaques and increased risk of bronchogenic carcinoma (same with smoking) and mesothelioma are key distinguishing features.</p>

      <h3>Berylliosis</h3>
      <p>Berylliosis is caused by occupational exposure to beryllium (e.g., aerospace, electronics, nuclear industries) and produces a noncaseating granulomatous lung disease resembling sarcoidosis. Patients develop progressive dyspnea and may have skin involvement. PFTs typically show restrictive disease with decreased DLCO. Imaging demonstrates an upper lobe reticular interstitial pattern and commonly presents with hilar lymphadenopathy. Histology reveals noncaseating granulomas. It is very similar to sarcoidosis. Occupational exposure history and confirmatory testing help differentiate it from sarcoidosis.</p>

      <h2 id="obstructive">Obstructive Lung Diseases</h2>
      <p>Obstructive lung diseases are characterized by increased resistance to airflow due to narrowing or obstruction of the airways, resulting in impaired expiratory flow. On PFT, they are defined by a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio (because the reduction in FEV1 exceeds that of FVC), often with normal or increased total lung capacity (TLC) due to air trapping. Residual volume (RV) and functional residual capacity (FRC) are typically increased, and DLCO varies depending on the underlying condition (decreased in emphysema, normal or increased in asthma). Common obstructive lung diseases include Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD, which includes two diseases: chronic bronchitis and emphysema), bronchial asthma, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis. Imaging may show signs of hyperinflation, flattened diaphragms, and an increased anteroposterior chest diameter.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">

      </div>
      <h3>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</h3>
      <p>COPD is a disease caused most commonly by long-term exposure to noxious particles (especially smoking) and encompasses a varying combination of both emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Patients develop progressive exertional dyspnea, chronic cough, sputum production, and wheezing. Labs during recurrent exacerbations of this disease may show leukocytosis; chronic hypoxemia can cause secondary polycythemia, and chronic elevated PaCO2 may produce elevated serum bicarbonate. PFTs show persistent obstructive physiology (decreased FEV1 and FEV1/FVC) with hyperinflation and only partial bronchodilator reversibility. DLCO varies depending on emphysema burden, with increased emphysema decreasing DLCO. Imaging shows hyperinflation and flattened diaphragms. Histology reveals chronic airway inflammation, mucus plugging, and loss of elastic recoil (if emphysema is present). High-yield clue: smoker with persistent, incompletely reversible obstruction and hyperinflation.</p>

      </div>
      <h3>COPD Due to Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency</h3>
      <p>COPD due to A1AT deficiency results from mutations in the SERPINA1 gene leading to reduced or dysfunctional alpha 1 antitrypsin (A1AT), a protease inhibitor that normally protects lung tissue from neutrophil elastase. Deficiency causes uninhibited elastase activity and destruction of pulmonary parenchyma, producing *panacinar emphysema, typically with basilar (lower lobe) predominance and earlier onset (< 50-60 y/o patient) compared to smoking-related COPD. Patients present with cough, wheezing, dyspnea, diminished breath sounds, barrel chest, and other COPD features, but at a younger age. Hepatic manifestations such as neonatal jaundice, hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma may also occur due to accumulation of misfolded A1AT in hepatocytes. PFTs show obstructive disease with hyperinflation and reduced DLCO. Chest imaging may reveal hyperinflation and characteristic panacinar emphysema on CT. Diagnosis is made by decreased serum A1AT levels followed by phenotyping or genotyping.</p>
      
      <p>*Centriacinar refers to the respiratory bronchioles, more "center" in the scheme of the lung, whereas panacinar refers to throughout the acinus, which is from the respiratory bronchioles to the alveoli.</p>

      <h3>Emphysema (part of COPD)</h3>
      <p>Emphysema is characterized by alveolar wall destruction leading to decreased elastic recoil and increased air trapping. Both smoking and A1AT deficiency cause emphysema; smoking increases protease activity and oxidative stress, while alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency results in uninhibited elastase activity. Patients typically have dyspnea greater than cough, minimal sputum, weight loss, and pursed-lip breathing ("pink puffer"). PFTs show an obstructive disease with hyperinflation and limited bronchodilator response. DLCO is decreased, a key discriminator from chronic bronchitis and asthma. CT shows low-attenuation areas: centrilobular (upper lobes = smokers) and panacinar (lower lobes = A1AT deficiency). Histology reveals enlarged airspaces and septal destruction with loss of alveolar surface area. Low DLCO and CT-scan emphysema pattern in upper lobes is COPD due to smoking, young patients with panacinar disease in lower lobes are more likely to have an A1AT deficiency.</p>

      <h3>Chronic Bronchitis (part of COPD)</h3>
      <p>Chronic bronchitis results from mucus hypersecretion and impaired ciliary clearance due to chronic irritant exposure, causing airway narrowing. Defined clinically by productive cough ≥ 3 months/year for ≥ 2 consecutive years. Patients often have frequent infections and may develop cor pulmonale with associated cyanosis ("blue bloater"). Labs may show secondary polycythemia and chronic respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation. PFTs show obstructive disease with limited reversibility. DLCO is usually normal, helping distinguish it from emphysema. Imaging may show increased bronchovascular markings and peribronchial cuffing. Histology shows increased Reid index (evaluated thickness of submucosal layer) > 0.4, mucous gland enlargement, goblet cell hyperplasia, and mucus plugging.</p>

      <h3>Bronchiectasis</h3>
      <p>Bronchiectasis is caused by permanent bronchial dilation due to chronic infection and/or inflammation, leading to impaired clearance and a vicious cycle of recurrent infections. Causes include cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia (Kartagener syndrome), immunodeficiency, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), and post-infectious damage. Patients present with chronic productive cough with copious, purulent sputum, recurrent infections, hemoptysis, crackles, wheeze, and clubbing. Labs may show pathogenic organisms on sputum culture (for example: Pseudomonas in cystic fibrosis); ABPA may show elevated IgE and eosinophilia. PFTs are often obstructive but may be mixed in advanced disease. DLCO is typically normal or mildly decreased unless significant parenchymal destruction exists. CT-scan shows tram-track lines, signet-ring sign, and bronchial wall thickening; distribution depends on cause (e.g., upper lobes in CF). Histology shows dilated airways with chronic inflammatory infiltrates and mucus plugging.</p>

      <h3>Asthma (General)</h3>
      <p>Asthma is characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness with reversible bronchoconstriction, mucus plugging, and inflammation (with eosinophils), with airway remodeling over time. Patients have episodic wheeze, cough (often nocturnal), chest tightness, and dyspnea triggered by allergens, viral infections, exercise, or cold air. Labs may show eosinophilia; severe attacks may initially cause respiratory alkalosis (decreased PaCO₂), with rising PaCO₂ signaling impending failure. PFTs show a reversible obstructive disease via methacholine challenge, which is a test that gradually causes bronchoconstriction in regular patients and major constriction in those with asthma. DLCO is normal or increased, distinguishing asthma from emphysema. Imaging is often normal or shows hyperinflation during attacks. Histology reveals Curschmann spirals (from inflammatory agents), Charcot-Leyden crystals (characterized by eosinophils), and smooth muscle hypertrophy.</p>

      <h3>Atopic (Extrinsic) Asthma</h3>
      <p>Atopic asthma is a type I hypersensitivity reaction driven by Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) and IgE, often beginning in childhood and associated with allergic rhinitis or eczema. Symptoms occur with allergen exposure and often have a family history of atopy. Labs typically show elevated IgE and eosinophilia with positive skin testing. PFTs show reversible obstructive disease. DLCO is normal or increased. Imaging is usually normal. Histology demonstrates eosinophils and mucus plugs.</p>

      <h3>Non-Atopic (Intrinsic) Asthma</h3>
      <p>Non-atopic asthma involves airway hyperreactivity without classic allergen sensitization and often begins in adulthood, triggered by viral infections, cold air, exercise, or irritants. IgE is often normal; eosinophilia may be present depending on phenotype. PFTs show reversible obstruction with normal/increased DLCO. Imaging is usually normal. Histology resembles other asthma types. Presents exactly like atopic asthma without any of the hypersensitivity findings.</p>
    
      <h3>Drug-Induced Asthma</h3>
      <p>Drug-induced asthma includes aspirin/NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), caused by COX-1 inhibition leading to increased leukotrienes, and bronchospasm from β-blockers. AERD presents with asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and NSAID sensitivity. PFTs show reversible obstructive disease, and DLCO is normal or increased. Imaging is usually normal. Histology reflects asthma-related changes.</p>
    
      <h3>Occupational Asthma</h3>
      <p>Occupational asthma is caused by sensitizer-induced (immune) or irritant-induced airway inflammation due to workplace exposures (flour, animal dander, wood dust, etc). Symptoms worsen at work and improve when away. PFTs show obstructive disease while at work, and normal while away. DLCO is normal or increased. Imaging is usually normal. Histology resembles other asthma forms.</p>

      <h2 id="lung-injury">Lung Injury</h2>
      <p>Lung injuries can come from many different causes, and locations within the lungs themselves can vary. This section will discuss the various etiologies, pathology, and clinical manifestations of pulmonary injury and the processes that impair lung function. Understanding the underlying mechanisms can help explain the resulting symptoms and characteristic imaging and physiologic findings seen in different diseases.</p>

      <h3>Pneumothorax</h3>
      <p>A pathological accumulation of air in the subpleural space is known as a pneumothorax. There are two types of pneumothorax: spontaneous and tension/traumatic. A spontaneous pneumothorax occurs when the lung bursts and air flows from inside the lung to the subpleural space. The most common way this occurs is via an "apical subpleural bleb" that progresses to a tear and is most likely to be seen in young, tall men. Causes of spontaneous pneumothorax can be idiopathic, emphysema, asthma, TB, or an abscess cavity. A tension pneumothorax occurs when trauma occurs in the chest wall and creates an inward valve that traps outside air in the subpleural space. A tension pneumothorax can be differentiated from a spontaneous one by the occurrence of trauma to the patient, and the deviation of the trachea away from the afflicted lung due to an increase in positive pressure. Pneumothorax presents as sharp chest pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, cyanosis (due to ventilation V/Q shunt), tachycardia, hyperresonance, and reduced breath sounds.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">

        </figure>
      </div>
      <h3>Atelectasis</h3>
      <p>Atelectasis is the pathological collapse of air spaces. This causes a ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) imbalance due to a lack of proper ventilation that results in subsequent hypoxemia. Mild cases of atelectasis may be asymptomatic, but moderate cases show signs of distress, dyspnea, tachypnea, a drop in Oxygen saturation, dullness to percussion (hyperresonance = pneumothorax), and decreased breath sounds. There are three main types of atelectasis: resorption/obstruction, compression, and contraction. Resorption atelectasis, or obstruction atelectasis, is caused by an airway obstruction (usually in the right main bronchus) that prevents ventilation from reaching distal alveoli, causing collapse of the airway. Compression atelectasis is due to compression on the lung caused typically by either air (pneumothorax) or fluid (pleural effusion). Contraction atelectasis, also known as cicatrization atelectasis, is when parenchymal scarring leads to tissue contractions and alveolar collapse. It is typically caused by pulmonary fibrosis and pleural fibrosis, and is usually not reversible.</p>

        </figure>
      </div>
      <h3>Pulmonary Edema</h3>
      <p>Pulmonary edema occurs when there is excess interstitial fluid in the alveoli. This, in turn, causes diminished gas exchange, A-a gradient increase, and heavy/wet lungs. Edema can be due to either hemodynamic origin (increased hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary vasculature, likely due to left-sided heart failure) or due to microvascular injury (leakage of vasculature leading to exudate accumulation). Symptoms of pulmonary edema are cardiac asthma (coughing, breathlessness, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), restlessness, anxiety, diaphoresis, pallor/cyanosis, tachycardia, hypertension, crackles on inspiration, and frothing at the mouth in extreme cases.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">

        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>There are two types of fluids that can cause edema: transudate and exudate. Transudate is caused by increased hydrostatic pressure, and is a clear, thin fluid with little solutes compared to exudate. It is characterized by low protein, WBCs, specific gravity, and a pleural fluid to serum protein ratio of < 0.5. Conversely, exudative edema is caused by increased capillary permeability (tears) and is a much thicker, colored fluid. It has high protein, WBCs, specific gravity, and a pleural fluid to serum protein ratio of > 0.5. Hemodynamic pulmonary edema, which involves transudative fluid, is the most common type of pulmonary edema.</p>

        </figure>
      </div>
      <h3>Hemodynamic Pulmonary Edema</h3>
      <p>Hemodynamic pulmonary edema, aka cardiogenic pulmonary edema, is typically caused by left-sided heart failure due to the buildup of hydrostatic pressure that LSHF causes. It presents on morphology as soggy, heavy lungs due to engorged alveolar capillaries. Histology reveals a pale transudate with heart failure cells (hemosiderin laden macrophages) and fibrosis/thickening of alveolar walls in chronic cases. Capillary blood with markedly decreased oncotic pressure (due to lack of solutes and protein) can also cause pulmonary edema.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">

        </figure>
      </div>
      <h3>Noncardiogenic Pulmonary Edema</h3>
      <p>This form of edema is due to microvascular injury that allows exudate to collect in the lung parenchyma. Causes include pneumonia/infection, noxious vapors/smoke, aspiration of foreign contents, radiation, and trauma. NPE is also highly associated with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), as the inflammatory injuries that occur during ARDS increase capillary permeability.</p>
      
      <h3>Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)</h3>
      <p>ALI is the onset of hypoxemia with bilateral, interstitial pulmonary edema in the absence of cardiac failure. ARDS is a severe manifestation of ALI, and involves the pathological buildup of excess fluid in the alveoli of the lungs. Both of these diseases involve the inflammation of the lung parenchyma, increased vascular permeability, edema, and cell death. In ARDS, inflammatory-mediated (IL-1, TNF-alpha) diffuse alveolar damage causes leakage of exudate and cellular debris into the alveoli, forming hyaline membranes along alveolar walls and impairing gas exchange. The decrease in type II pneumocytes also causes a subsequent decrease in surfactant, increasing surface tension and impairing gas exchange.</p>

      <p>Resolution of ALI/ARDS involves the release of TGFB and PDGF from macrophages as they phagocytize debris. Fibrosis occurs in the lung parenchyma due to this increase in TGFB and collagen deposition occurs due to the increase in cytokines. Type II pneumocyte proliferation increases the number of epithelial cells to replace what was lost during injury. Endothelial proliferation also occurs. On morphology, afflicted lungs present with diffuse consolidations of illness with greasy, elastic, firm tissue due to the interstitial edema. Lungs also appear heavy and shrunken due to the fibrosis and collapse of alveolar tissue, and can also present with hemorrhage. On CT, multifocal opacities can be observed. In histological presentation, diffuse alveolar damage is present.</p>

      </div>
      <h3>Diffuse Alveolar Damage (DAD)</h3>
      <p>The key feature of DAD is the appearance of thick hyaline membranes lining the alveoli during the acute exudative phase of ALI/ARDS. These waxy outlines also present with fibrin and cellular debris, see a marked increase in hemorrhage and neutrophilic infiltrate, and cause alveolar collapse with distention.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">

          <figcaption>Diffuse alveolar damage in ALI/ARDS</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>After the exudative stage is the proliferation stage, in which type II pneumocytes proliferate and rebuild the regular parenchymal epithelium. Transient granulation tissue and thickening of the alveolar septa due to fibrosis may also occur. The hyaline membrane degrades and is replaced by interstitial fibroblasts.</p>

      <p>After the proliferation phase is the Fibrosis stage, which is characterized by Masson bodies, fibroblast proliferation, and intra-alveolar fibrosis. This stage is only seen in severe cases.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">
        <figure>

          <figcaption>Masson body (sorry for blurry image)</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>Clinical features of DAD, ALI, and ARDS are initially hypoxemia, dyspnea, and tachypnea. Features can progress to hypoxemia and cyanosis. Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates are visible on chest X-Ray as a white-out lung. Sputum may appear as white-pink and frothy. As previously mentioned, stiffening of the lungs due to fibrosis and loss of surfactant is characteristic. These diseases also present a V/Q mismatch due to lack of proper ventilation.</p>

      <p>Sepsis, pulmonary infections, aspiration, toxin exposure, and traumatic lung injury are all risk factors for developing ALI/ARDS. There are also numerous systemic conditions that can increase risk as well.</p>

      <h3>Pulmonary Embolism</h3>
      <p>A pulmonary embolism (PE, not to be confused with pulmonary edema) is an emboli that occludes pulmonary vasculature. It is typically due to deep vein thromboemboli (due to risk factors like prolonged bed rest, leg surgery, hypercoagulable state, malignancy, heart failure, and high estrogen). Most patients with pulmonary embolism are asymptomatic, and most PE affect the lower lobes of the lungs. Small, symptomatic emboli present with dyspnea, V/Q mismatch, peripheral location, and pulmonary infarction (necrosis of the lung tissue). Large emboli also cause these symptoms more severely, and can also cause sudden death.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">

          <figcaption>White is pulmonary arteries, gray is are blodd clots (emboli).</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>One important concept to remember regarding PE is Virchow's triad: endothelial injury, abnormal blood flow, and hypercoagulability. These all lead to increased likelihood of thrombosis formation and, by extension, PE. Hypercoagulable states are due to genetic predispositions, obesity, recent surgery, cancer, high estrogen, and pregnancy.</p>
 
      <h3>Histology and Morphology of PE</h3>
      <p>Lines of Zahn are present in pathological findings of pulmonary embolism. They do not occur in clots that form postmortem, meaning that a patient must be alive when the PE with Lines of Zahn occurs. The clot will present with layers of red cells and fibrin that attach it to the vasculature.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">

      </div>
      <p>A saddle embolus occurs at the bifurcation of the main pulmonary trunk into the right and left pulmonary arteries. This is also typically due to a DVT. Saddle emboli are severe, and can cause cor pulmonale, shock, and sudden death.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">
        <figure>

          <figcaption>White is pulmonary artery, gray is saddle embolism.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <h3>Clinical Features of PE</h3>
      <p>A D-dimer (fibrin degradation product used to detect clots) screening test can be used to rule out PE in suspected patients. A D-dimer < 500 ng/mL is normal. CT pulmonary angiogram is used to detect obstructed arteries, and other tests (V/Q scan, ultrasound, Chest X-Ray) can be used to confirm the diagnosis. PE is treated with anticoagulants (Heparin and Warfarin) and an IVC filter. It can be prevented with compression stockings and anticoagulants.</p>

      <h3>Pulmonary Infarction</h3>
      <p>Lack of blood supply to areas distal of the lung can lead to tissue necrosis. The most common cause of this is PE. Infarcted lung tissue forms a wedge shaped opacity on X-ray. Hemorrhage can also be present. The pleura surrounding the infarct becomes covered in a fibrinous exudate. On morphology, the infarcted area changes to a red-brown color due to hemosiderin. A healed infarct will still present with fibrosis.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">

        </figure>
      </div>
      <h3>Pulmonary Hypertension (PH)</h3>
      <p>An increase in mean arterial pressure of at least 20-25 mmHg in the pulmonary arteries indicates pulmonary hypertension. PH can be genetic in origin (due to BMPR2 loss of function mutation), due to left heart failure, lung disease, hypoxia, chronic thromboemboli, or idiopathic. Most cases are due to a mutated BMPR2 gene. This gene normally inhibits the function of TGFB which, when left unchecked, causes intimal fibrosis and medial hypertrophy. Occluded vasculature leads to hypertension. Morphology presents vascular changes, and histology shows hyperplasia of the tunica media of vessels. Plexiform lesions are also present in histology; a plexiform lesion is a web of capillaries engulfing dilated small arteries. Especially common in advanced idiopathic pulmonary hypertension.</p>

      </div>
      <h3>Clinical Features of Pulmonary Hypertension</h3>
      <p>Early symptoms of PH include dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, and chest pain. Disease symptoms can advance to syncope, cyanosis, cor pulmonale, and peripheral edema. Signs of right heart failure (split S2, S3, tricuspid regurgitation, JVD) and normal lung auscultation are common. Treated with diuretics, anticoagulants, vasodilators, and lung transplant in extreme cases.</p>
      
      <h3>Pulmonary Hemorrhage</h3>
      <p>Diffuse bleeding into the alveoli is life-threatening. Goodpasture syndrome (pathological production of anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies, specifically against collagen IV), idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, and vasculitis are all causes of hemorrhage. Symptoms of hemorrhage are dyspnea, hemoptysis, and hypoxia. Morphology shows a lung with a heavy red-brown consolidation. Histology shows hemosiderin-laden macrophages. Late stages of hemorrhage present fibrosis of the alveolar septa, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, and dark, old blood. Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis causes a productive cough, hemoptysis, anemia, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. It is suspected to be an autoimmune disease, and responds to steroids and immune suppression.</p>

      <p>Vasculitis associated hemorrhage, also known as Granulomatosis and polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis), is an autoimmune disease that afflicts the URT and lungs with necrotic granulomas. Highly associated with rapidly progressive kidney injury (RPKI) and is an ANCA positive vasculitis. Symptoms include bilateral pneumonitis, nodules and cavitary lesions, sinusitis, ulcerations, renal disease, rash, and joint pain. High mortality if left untreated. The characteristic granuloma is poorly-formed and necrotizing, with abundant neutrophils.</p>

      <h3>Diseases of the Larynx and the Pleura</h3>
      <p>Laryngeal diseases are typically nodules, papillomas, and carcinomas. A nodule is a smooth mass on the vocal cords, only millimeters in dimension. A papilloma is a benign epithelial tumor, and a carcinoma is a malignant epithelial tumor. Pleural diseases include pleural effusion, pneumothorax, metastatic tumors, fibrous tumors, and malignant mesotheliomas.</p>

      <h3>Laryngeal Diseases</h3>
      <p>Laryngitis is the inflammation of the larynx, and is distinct from epiglottitis. Epiglottitis is a specifically rapid bacterial infection of the epiglottis and supraglottis which causes airway obstruction. It may be life-threatening in young children, and is typically caused by H. influenzae or beta-hemolytic streptococci. It presents with inspiratory stridor, drooling, fever, and no cough. Laryngitis is a much more minor infection localized only in the larynx, and presents with hoarse voice, dry/sore throat, and coughing.</p>

      <h3>Laryngeal Nodules</h3>
      <p>Laryngeal nodules, also called singer's nodules or vocal cord polyps (polyps are unilateral and nodules are bilateral), are benign growths on the true vocal cords. They are smooth masses covered by squamous epithelium with a myxoid CT core, and possible ulceration or fibrosis. Nodules are caused by strain on the vocal cords and/or smoking, and also cause hoarseness of voice.</p>

      <p>Papillomas are benign neoplasms on the true vocal cords. They have central fibrovascular cores covered by squamous epithelium, and are 0.5-1.0 cm in length. Typically, only one will present in adults, but multiple will occur in children with HPV 6 or 11. They have low risk of malignant transformation.</p>

      <h3>Laryngeal Carcinoma</h3>
      <p>Carcinomas are malignant neoplasms that arise from squamous cells. Age, alcohol history, asbestos exposure, radiation, HPV, and smoking history increase likelihood of development. Symptoms of a laryngeal carcinoma are hoarseness, dysphagia, and dysphonia (breathy voice). Treatment involves surgical removal, radiation and chemotherapy, and laryngotomy (incision into airway). Morphology of this type of carcinoma displays an ulcerated lesion on the vocal cords. Histology reveals giant tumor cells, erratic mitosis, and dysplasia of nearby cells both in the mucosa and submucosa.</p>

      <h3>Pleural Effusion</h3>
      <p>Pleural effusion (not shortened as PE because PE is pulmonary embolism, or in some cases pulmonary edema depending on who's talking) is the pathological accumulation of excess fluid in the pleural space. Normal pleural fluid is about 15 mL in volume, clear, and acellular. Symptoms of pleural effusion are dyspnea, chest pain, cough, orthopnea, and possible fever if the effusion is due to infection. Signs show asymmetric chest expansion, percussive dullness, decreased breath sounds, and crackles.</p>

      <p>Pleural effusions can be caused by an increase in hydrostatic pressure (due to heart failure), increased vascular permeability (likely due to pneumonia), decreased vascular osmotic pressure, decreased lymphatic drainage, and increased intrapleural negative pressure (due to atelectasis). The effusion itself can be an exudate, empyema (pus accumulation due to bacteria) or hemorrhagic pleuritis (both are in the pleural space, but hemothorax has more than 50% hematocrit when compared to the hematocrit in the blood). Causes of pleural effusions are: TB, pneumonia, lung infarct, lung abscess, bronchiectasis, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, Uremia, diffuse infection, metastatic lung cancer, and radio therapy.</p>
 
      <p>Empyema is a "purulent exudate" (fancy word for pus) and as such has an abundance of bacteria, neutrophils and other leukocytes, and cell debris. Empyema heals through fibrosis. Hemorrhagic pleuritis occurs due to hemorrhage, infection, or malignancy. It should be differentiated from hemothorax. A hemothorax is usually due to trauma or aortic aneurysm (usually fatal) and has at least 50% of blood hematocrit (the percentage of the fluid that is RBCs). A hydrothorax is a serous, clear fluid that is low in protein and due to heart failure. A chylothorax is due to lymphatic obstruction (thoracic duct) and is a milky accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity due to an abundance of triglycerides.</p>

      <h3>Pleural Tumors</h3>
      <p>Pleural tumors typically present with pleural effusion. Metastatic tumors (tumors that arise from cells located in a different part of the body) are more common than primary tumors (same cell type as location in body). Metastatic spread can be diagnosed by pleural fluid cytology, the presence of neoplastic cells on thoracentesis. Neoplastic cells have enlarged nuclei and cytoplasmic vacuoles.</p>

        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>Solitary fibrous tumors are usually not malignant and remain attached to the pleural surface. A "NAB2-STAT6" fusion gene is diagnostic of this type of tumor. In histology, whorls of reticulin and collagen fibers can be seen, as well as spindle (elongated) cells. Tissue tests negative for keratin, stains CD34 positive, and STAT6 negative. It is not a type of mesothelioma.</p>

      <p>Malignant mesotheliomas are highly lethal pleural malignancies associated with asbestos exposure that also cause pleural effusions. On morphology, large fibrocalcific plaque coats cover the pleural surface. It is common for patients to also have asbestos bodies present in histological observation, and subsequent asbestosis (a type of pneumoconiosis). Surgical removal of the afflicted pleura, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy are all potential treatments of mesothelioma.</p>

      <p>There are three types of histological variants of mesotheliomas: epithelioid (80%), sarcomatous (10%), and biphasic (10%). Epithelioid displays cuboidal cells that form tubular structures, similar to adenocarcinoma. In contrast, the sarcomatoid variant is composed of spindle-shaped cells arranged in fascicles, resembling fibrosarcoma, and is typically associated with a worse prognosis. The biphasic subtype contains both epithelioid and sarcomatoid components, with each constituting at least 10% of the tumor.</p>

          <figcaption>Types of mesothelioma presentations.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>Malignant mesotheliomas are characterized by recurrent tumor suppressor gene alterations, most commonly homozygous deletion of CDKN2A on chromosome 9 (seen in 80% of mesothelioma cases), as well as mutations in NF2, a regulator of cell signaling, and BAP1, which interacts with the BRCA1 tumor suppressor and significantly increases mesothelioma risk when mutated. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) plays a key role in distinguishing mesothelioma from adenocarcinoma; loss of MTAP (a surrogate marker for CDKN2A deletion) and loss of BAP1 expression are diagnostically supportive of mesothelioma. Mesotheliomas stain positive for mesothelial markers including keratin, calretinin, WT-1, cytokeratin 5/6, and podoplanin, while staining negative for markers more characteristic of lung adenocarcinoma such as Claudin-4 and TTF-1. Moreover, cytology of the pleural effusion in mesothelioma shows clusters of pleomorphic epithelioid cells in sheets.</p>

      <h2 id="lung-tumors">Lung Tumors and Cancer</h2>
      <p>Lung cancer is the most diagnosed cancer and the number 1 cause of cancer mortality in the United States. Lung cancer kills more people than colon, breast, and prostate cancer combined. It typically occurs in patients between 55-84 and is highly associated with smoking. Lung cancer can arise due to metastasis from other locations in the body and can also originate within the lungs. Small cell carcinoma typically has the worst prognosis, as it is a cancer that begins in the central areas within the lungs and metastasizes before it can be diagnosed.</p>

      <p>Tobacco interacts with the P-450 monooxygenase system (CYP450) as a procarcinogen. CYP450 turns tobacco into a carcinogen that then causes leukocyte chromosomal damage. Epithelial changes in lung tissue (basal cell hyperplasia leading to squamous cell metaplasia, then dysplasia and carcinoma) can occur, and can further be induced by environmental and genetic factors. Asbestos, radon, arsenic, chromium, nickel, chloride, and mustard gas are all agents that can cause cancer.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">
        <figure>
          <img src="https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fnrc.2017.68/MediaObjects/41568_2017_Article_BFnrc201768_Fig1_HTML.jpg" alt="Image">

        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>If a patient is not exposed to smoke or any other extraneous factor, cancer can still occur. Typically adenocarcinoma arises due to genetic factors such as mutations in protooncogenes (EGFR or TP53). Nonsmokers do not typically show KRAS mutations. On gross morphology, neoplastic tissue that appears gray-white and is firm/hard is visible on the lung. Focal areas of hemorrhage and necrosis, appearing as yellow-white mottling/cavitations, are also commonly seen.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">
        <figure>

          <figcaption>Adenocarcinoma gross appearance.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>Symptoms of lung cancer are dyspnea, worsening cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, wheezing, aching chest pain, hoarse voice, weight loss (when weight loss is not attempted) loss of appetite, fatigue/weakness, and paraneoplastic syndromes. Paraneoplastic syndromes (many of which are seen in small cell lung cancer) are determined by cancer type and location. Metastatic symptoms include enlarged supraclavicular lymph nodes, bone pain, neurologic symptoms, and jaundice. Cancers can also cause secondary pathologies, such as bronchial obstruction, emphysematous changes, atelectasis, abscesses, pericarditis/pleuritis, and pleural effusions.</p>
 
      <p>Lung cancers have various different treatments depending on underlying causes. Adenocarcinomas with mutations in EGFR are treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma are treated with checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and small cell lung cancer is treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy.</p>
  
      <p>Lung cancers can spread to nearly all parts of the body by using both the vasculature and the lymphatic system. Lung cancer is likely to spread to the pleural surface, lymph nodes, adrenal glands, liver, brain, and bones. Metastasis is early in all lung cancer cases except squamous cell carcinoma.</p>
   
      <h3>Lung Cancer TNM Staging</h3>
      <p>TNM staging stands for (T)umor size, lymph (N)odes, and (M)etastasis (spread). T is ranked T1-4, with T1 being <3 cm, T2 being 3-5 cm, T3 is 5-7, and T4 is >7. Tis is denoted for in-situ lesions, or tumors that appear in areas of the body normal for that cell type. Nodal involvement is N0 for no nodes, N1 for ipsilateral nodes, N2 for distal ipsilateral nodes, and N3 for contralateral nodes. Metastasis is either M0 for no distant metastasis, and M1 for distant metastasis.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">

        </figure>
      </div>
      
      <p>Lung cancers (which are also called bronchogenic carcinomas) are histologically classified as well. The most common form of lung cancer is adenocarcinoma (50%), which is the cancerous growth of glandular tissue. In the lung, this refers to goblet cells, type II pneumocytes, or club cells. Squamous cell carcinoma (20%) is commonly caused by smoking. Small cell (15%) comes from poorly-differentiated neuroendocrine cells, large cell carcinoma (2%) arises from undifferentiated cells, and carcinoid tumors develop from well-differentiated neuroendocrine cells. Non-small cell lung cancers include adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. Furthermore, many different types of cancer from other parts of the body can metastasize in the lungs. These metastatic tumors cause cannonball lesions on the periphery of the lung and display unique immunohistochemical (IHC) markers depending on origin.</p>

        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>Primary lung cancers display TTF-1 (mainly adenocarcinoma and small cell lung carcinoma), Cytokeratin 5/6 is displayed by squamous cell carcinoma, and chromogranin is displayed by small cell lung carcinoma, carcinoid tumors, and large cell neuroendocrine tumors. Breast cancers show ER/PR and GATA3. Colorectal cancers show CEA, CK20, and CD15. Renal cell carcinoma shows PAX8, and melanoma shows S100.</p>

      <h3>Adenocarcinoma (and Adenocarcinoma in situ)</h3>
      <p>Atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) is a small (usually 5 mm), pre-invasive, focal lesion in the lung, characterized by the proliferation of mildly atypical type II pneumocytes or Clara cells along the alveolar walls. It is considered a precursor to pulmonary adenocarcinoma.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">
        <figure>

        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>Adenocarcinoma in situ (formerly called bronchioalveolar carcinoma) is a mass typically less than 3 cm in which dysplastic cells (goblet, club, pneumocytes, etc) all grown along the alveolar septa, often with abundant mucin.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">

        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>Adenocarcinoma is the most common lung cancer in nonsmokers. It is derived from type II pneumocytes and primarily affects glandular structures. It is characterized by abundant mucin production. On gross morphology, this type of cancer occurs mainly in the periphery of the lung with visible central scarring and necrosis. One can see an abundance of glands (and fibrosis) in histology, and this type of tumor stains TTF-1 positive. Septal walls appear much thicker than normal, causing emphysematous changes in patients.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">

        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>In immunohistochemistry, TTF-1, Napsin A, CK7, and Surfactant Protein A all come back as positive. The acquired mutations of adenocarcinoma are a tyrosine kinase gain of function mutation in EGFR or another protooncogene like ALK, Serine/threonine gain of function from either BRAF or PI3K, and a KRAS mutation.</p>
     
      <h3>Squamous Cell Carcinoma</h3>
      <p>The normal epithelium of the conducting respiratory tract consists of ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, goblet cells, basal cells, a basement membrane, blood vessels, bronchial glands, and cartilage underneath. Smoking-damaged epithelium can become precursor lesions, in which goblet and basal cell hyperplasia is visible on histology, and squamous cell metaplasia (so instead of being pseudostratified, epithelium is now stratified squamous). Further dysmorphic lesions can display squamous, dysplastic cells with a visible loss of nuclear polarity, nuclear hyperchromasia, pleomorphism, and mitotic figures. Carcinoma in situ (in situ = in normal location) is the stage immediately preceding invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Cells have yet to penetrate the basement membrane to metastasize.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">
        <figure>

        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>Squamous cell carcinoma is centrally located and most common in smoking males. The growth of squamous cell carcinoma can both move towards the bronchial lumen and cause distal atelectasis and pneumonia. It can also penetrate the bronchial wall and metastasize in the mediastinum or carina. Further growth can cause compression-like symptoms.</p>

        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>Squamous cell carcinoma can cause hemoptysis due to bleeding lesions in the respiratory tract. On gross morphology, the centrally-located mass is white-gray and firm, with cavitation. In histology, keratinization (keratin pearls) is visible. Tumor cells also have very eosinophilic (red) cytoplasm, hyperchromatic nuclei (dark-colored nucleus), and intercellular bridges. They appear larger than neutrophils.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">

        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>In immunohistochemistry, P40/P63 are highly expressed. These two transcription factors are very useful for distinguishing squamous cell carcinoma from other types of lung cancer. Cytokeratin 5/6 is also present, and Cytokeratin 20 is also positive.</p>

      <p>Squamous cell carcinoma is caused by tobacco smoke and the loss of function oncogenes CDKN2A, TP53, and p16 tumor suppressor gene. It is also caused by an amplification of tyrosine kinase and the FGFR1 fibroblast growth receptor gene.</p>

      <h3>Large Cell Carcinoma</h3>
      <p>Large cell carcinoma is characterized by poorly differentiated, large tumor cells with abundant cytoplasm and prominent pleomorphism. It is typically located in the peripheral lung and is strongly associated with cigarette smoking. It is an aggressive tumor with a tendency for early metastasis and overall poor prognosis. In histology, large cell carcinoma lacks identifiable glandular, squamous, or neuroendocrine differentiation, making it a diagnosis of exclusion that can only be definitively established on biopsy; it has variable IHC markers as it only sometimes displays TTF-1, Napsin A, and the common neuroendocrine markers Chromogranin A and Synaptophysin.</p>

        </figure>
      </div>
      <h3>Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (SCLC)</h3>
      <p>SCLC is almost always due to cigarette smoking. It is highly malignant, highly aggressive, and almost always fatal. Metastasis is very common at diagnosis (in liver, bone, lymph nodes, and brain). Paraneoplastic syndromes are common; SCLC can cause subsequent: syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH), ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, and SVC syndrome.</p>

      <p>On gross morphology, SCLC is located centrally, typically on the major bronchi. It presents as a central mass with damage to surrounding structures and nodes. In histology, SCLC appears with an abundance of small, poorly-differentiated, dark blue cells known as Kulchitsky cells. Kulchitsky cells originate from poorly-differentiated neuroendocrine cells, and have hyperchromatic nuclei with a classic "salt and pepper" chromatin pattern and little visible cytoplasm. One can also see many mitotic figures in histology.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">
        <figure>
          <img src="https://prod-images-static.radiopaedia.org/images/298101/3986ad703b9c8b6d6b5cc6348b4463_big_gallery.jpg" alt="Image">

          <figcaption>Small Cell Lung Carcinoma histology. Note the small, dark blue cells with little cytoplasm.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>SCLC expresses neuroendocrine markers: Chromogranin A, Synaptophysin, Neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and CD56 (NCAM). Dense core granules contain these (with the exception of NSE) and such granules/markers are also seen in carcinoid tumors. One can differentiate SCLC's IHC from carcinoid tumor IHC with the presence of TTF-1. TTF-1 is usually positive in SCLCs and negative in carcinoid tumors. Genetically, Rb tumor suppressor gene inactivations, 3p chromosome loss, inactivation of TP53, and amplification of myc all cause SCLC.</p>

      <h3>Carcinoid Tumors</h3>
      <p>Carcinoid tumors arise from well-differentiated neuroendocrine cells of the lung; they may arise in either central or peripheral locations and are the most common primary lung cancer in children and adolescents. Unlike other lung cancers, they are not strongly associated with cigarette smoking and typically have a good prognosis. Metastases are rare, and symptoms, when present, are often related to mass effect, such as wheezing.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">
        <figure>
          <img src="https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/imgau/lungtumorcarcinoidjoubert35.jpg" alt="Image">
          <figcaption>Similar histology to SCLC but with more uniform cells and less mitotic activity.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>Since lung carcinoids come from neuroendocrine cells, they can often cause carcinoid syndromes. Carcinoid syndrome is the overproduction of neuroendocrine chemicals such as serotonin, histamine, and tachykinins. Carcinoid syndrome produces systemic effects throughout the body and causes symptoms of skin flushing, diarrhea, wheezing, dyspnea, tachycardia, and telangiectasis (spider veins) on nose and upper lip. Increased serotonin metabolism increases the activity of the enzyme Monoamine oxidase (MAO) which turns serotonin into 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) that is then secreted in the urine.</p>

      <p>Carcinoid tumors can be either centrally or peripherally located. They appear in two forms: collar-button lesion and polypoid lesion. The former involves the penetration of the bronchial wall and is solid and nodular. The polypoid lesion is finger-like and covered in mucosa. In histology, nests and cords of cells can be seen. The tumor cells themselves are moderately-sized, uniform, rounded, and have eosinophilic (lightly-stained) cytoplasm with uniform nuclei. On IHC, TTF-1 is usually negative. The typical neuroendocrine markers (Synaptophysin, Chromogranin A, and CD56 (NCAM)) are all present. Ki-67 is also present, with more expression being associated with more aggressiveness.</p>

      <h3>Mesothelioma</h3>
      <p>Mesothelioma is commonly caused by asbestos exposure in patients ages 60-80. Symptoms include dyspnea and cough due to pleural effusion, ipsilateral chest pain, weight loss, and fatigue. On gross morphology, extensive pleural tissue thickening can be observed. Thoracentesis reveals malignant cells, which also invade other thoracic structures. In histology, the epithelioid subtype of mesothelioma presents with cuboidal cells forming tubular structures. The appearance somewhat resembles adenocarcinoma. The cytology of the pleural effusion reveals clusters of epithelioid cells in sheets. In IHC, a lack of MTAP and BAP1 is notable. Mesothelioma is positive for Calretinin, Cytokeratin 5/6, WT-1, and podoplanin. Negative for Claudin4 and TTF-1.</p>

      <h3>Other Lung Tumors</h3>
      <p>A benign tumor is one that does not metastasize and is less than 5 cm in diameter. They will often appear on chest CT as a coin lesion. Cartilage and fibrous tissue with calcifications are common culprits. A pulmonary hamartoma is a benign growth of cells found in situ (can be cartilage, smooth muscle, fat, etc). Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare cystic lung disease caused by abnormal proliferation of smooth muscle-like cells that infiltrate the bronchioles, blood vessels, and lymphatics. It is caused by a TSC2 loss of function and is treated with mTOR inhibitors. Can cause dyspnea and pneumothorax. Finally, an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor can occur (most likely in children) and present with fever, cough, chest pain, and hemoptysis. This presents on histology as spindle shaped fibroblasts, and is caused by an overactive ALK gene. Treated with ALK inhibitors.</p>

      </div>
      <h3>Paraneoplastic Syndromes</h3>
      <p>Paraneoplastic syndromes are subsequent symptoms of malignancy caused by the errant metabolism of cancer cells. Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) is one such syndrome, and is caused by SCLC. ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome is another cause due to SCLC, as is Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Superior Vena Cava syndrome is caused by centrally-located tumors (SCLC or squamous cell carcinoma). Parathyroid receptor Peptide (PTHrP) is caused by squamous cell carcinoma and causes hypercalcemia. Pancoast tumors are caused by squamous and adenocarcinoma and cause Homer's triad (ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis). Finally, hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy causes clubbing and bone pain, mostly due to adenocarcinoma.</p>
      
      <p>Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH Secretion (SIADH) is most classically associated with Small cell lung carcinoma. Tumor cells produce excess ADH (vasopressin) independent of normal regulation. In SIADH, excess ADH causes increased free water retention resulting in dilutional hyponatremia, low serum osmolality, and relatively concentrated urine. Although total body water increases, patients are typically euvolemic (no peripheral edema) because compensatory natriuresis leads to increased urinary sodium and uric acid excretion. Clinically, the most dangerous consequence is cerebral edema.</p>
 
      <p>ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome is a paraneoplastic condition most classically associated with SCLC, though it can occur with other tumors. In this syndrome, malignant cells secrete ACTH. The excess ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex, leading to bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and markedly increased cortisol production (hypercortisolism). Clinically, patients develop classic features of Cushing syndrome, including central obesity, moon facies, abdominal striae, muscle weakness, hypertension, and hyperglycemia.</p>

      <p>Lambert-Eaton syndrome is an autoimmune response to neuroendocrine cells that begins to afflict proximal muscle innervations. Antibodies to neuron calcium channels form, causing proximal muscle weakness, dry mouth, impotence, and constipation. This one is usually seen in SCLC.</p>

      <p>Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome is a complication caused by lung cancers arising centrally in the bronchi, particularly SCLC, though it can occur with all major lung cancer types (classically squamous cell > adenocarcinoma). Tumor growth or associated lymphadenopathy compresses the superior vena cava, impairing venous return from the head, neck, and upper extremities. This leads to jugular venous distention, venous congestion, facial edema, and arm swelling. With more severe obstruction, patients may develop cyanosis, dyspnea, headache, and dysphagia due to increased venous pressure and impaired drainage.</p>
 
      <p>PTHrP, which is the excess creation of a parathyroid-like peptide by squamous cell carcinoma, mimics the effects of PTH and causes hypercalcemia by functioning on the intestines, kidneys, and bones.</p>

      <p>Pancoast tumors are mainly caused by squamous cell and adenocarcinomas, but can be seen in other lung cancer types. A Pancoast tumor is an apical lung cancer arising in the superior pulmonary sulcus; because of its location at the lung apex, the tumor tends to invade or compress nearby neurovascular structures rather than initially causing classic pulmonary symptoms. Invasion of the brachial plexus (C5–T1 roots) produces severe, persistent shoulder pain radiating down the medial arm and hand, sometimes with weakness or atrophy. Venous compression can impair drainage from the upper extremity, leading to arm swelling. Extension into the cervical sympathetic chain results in ipsilateral Horner syndrome, characterized by ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis due to disruption of sympathetic innervation to the eye and face.</p>

      <p>Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPOA) is a paraneoplastic syndrome most commonly associated with peripheral lung tumors, particularly adenocarcinoma. It is characterized by periosteal new bone formation along the long bones, leading to bone pain and tenderness, along with digital clubbing and symmetric arthralgias. The pathophysiology is thought to involve tumor-derived growth factors (such as VEGF and PDGF) that stimulate vascular proliferation and periosteal bone growth.</p>

      <h2 id="urti">Upper Respiratory Tract Infections</h2>
      <p>Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are some of the most common infectious diseases encountered in clinical practice. These infections can be both viral or bacterial, and their clinical manifestations vary based on the anatomic site involved and the host immune response. Understanding the anatomical location of infection, likely etiologic agents, mechanisms of pathogenesis, and characteristic symptom patterns is essential for accurate diagnosis, appropriate management, and recognition of potential complications. The defining features of common URT syndromes (including the common cold, rhinitis, sinusitis, laryngitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, epiglottitis, and croup) will be discussed, as well as pathophysiology and complications of untreated disease. In addition, infectious causes of cough and wheezing will be explored, along with strategies for generating a focused differential diagnosis based on clinical presentation and diagnostic findings.</p>

      <p>The common cold is caused by a variety of viruses that infect the nasal mucosa and upper airway epithelium. Rhinoviruses are the most frequent cause. Coronaviruses are another major contributor, especially in winter months. Adenoviruses can cause more prolonged symptoms and are often associated with conjunctivitis or pharyngitis. Parainfluenza viruses typically cause mild upper respiratory symptoms in adults but are also important causes of croup in children. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus more commonly cause lower respiratory tract disease in infants and older adults but frequently begin with upper respiratory symptoms resembling the common cold.</p>

      <p>Rhinitis is inflammation of the nasal cavities and mucosa that can be acute or chronic. It is characterized by rhinorrhea (watery discharge), edematous and erythematous nasal mucosa, narrowing of the nasal passages, and enlarged turbinates due to vascular congestion and mucosal swelling. Acute rhinitis is most commonly viral in origin, with typical causative agents including rhinovirus, adenovirus, and echovirus, which infect the nasal epithelium and trigger local inflammatory mediator release. Chronic rhinitis may result from persistent inflammation due to allergens (allergic rhinitis) or from recurrent or superimposed bacterial infection, particularly when mucociliary clearance is impaired. The underlying pathophysiology involves epithelial irritation, cytokine release, increased vascular permeability, trigeminal (V1 and V2) stimulation (sneezing), and mucus hypersecretion.</p>

      <p>Sinusitis is inflammation of the paranasal cavities (sinuses) secondary to viral URT infection. Its symptoms are: rhinorrhea, cough for over 10 days without improvement, fever, and nasal congestion. Sinusitis can be caused by normal oral microbiota. Common microbes are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilia influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis. Swelling of the mucosa causes sinus ostia, a blockage of the flow of mucus causes stasis within the sinuses, allowing increased bacterial growth. Constant irritation (sneezing and coughing) can further push flora into the sinuses. Clearance is impaired, mucus thickens, and an inflammatory response with increased microbe replication ensues. Inflammation and infection can cause remodelling of the nasal sinuses, biofilm production, and nasal polyps.</p>

      <p>Pharyngitis presents with a triad of sore throat, fever, and inflammation. Further associated symptoms are headache and cough (cough is typically secondary to viral infection). Typical causal microbes are Adenovirus, Echovirus, Rhinovirus, Influenza, RSV, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) also causes pharyngitis; The GAS bacteria adhere to and culture in the oropharynx via virulence factors (M protein protects GAS against phagocytosis and opsonization and lipoteichoic acid allows microbe adhesion to the oropharynx) and trigger an inflammatory response that causes the anterior lymph nodes to swell.</p>

      <p>Conversely, laryngitis is the inflammation of the larynx. Its associated symptoms are hoarseness of voice, decreased voice volume, and dry cough. It can be caused by both viral and bacterial infections: Parainfluenza, Rhinovirus, Coronavirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Group A Streptococcus. Swelling and inflammation of the vocal cords causes edema in the superficial lamina propria (layer just under the epithelium, also referred to as the Reinke space in the vocal cords) causing hoarseness and loss of voice. Further stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve (branch of CN X) can also trigger dry cough.</p>

      <p>Tonsillitis is the inflammation of the tonsils, usually secondary to another diagnosis. Symptoms of tonsillits are sore throat, swollen tonsils, difficulty swallowing, and visible spots on the tonsils. Can be caused by GAS, Adenovirus, Echovirus, Rhinovirus, and Influenza. Pathogens diffusing deep into tissues trigger inflammation. The result is tonsillar swelling, erythema, pain, and sometimes exudate formation due to accumulation of inflammatory cells and debris within the tonsils.</p>

      <p>Epiglottitis is the invasive cellulitis of the epiglottis and increases risk of upper airway obstruction. Its associated symptoms are fever, dysphagia, odynophagia, sore throat, tender larynx, respiratory distress, stridor, and the "Thumbprint sign" on X-Ray. Common microbes that cause epiglottitis are S. pneumoniae, GAS, H. influenzae, and the Parainfluenza virus. Its pathogenesis is similar to those of other diseases stated above.</p>

      <h2 id="mucosal-immunity">Mucosal Immunity</h2>
      <p>The microbiota of the upper respiratory tract play a critical role in maintaining mucosal integrity and immune homeostasis. Native organisms provide a physical "coating effect" over epithelial surfaces and occupy ecological niches, limiting pathogen attachment and growth through colonization resistance. These microbes also produce metabolites that help strengthen the epithelial barrier and modulate local immune signaling. Importantly, the upper respiratory tract microbiota promotes an immune environment with regulatory T cells (Tregs) and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β, preventing excessive inflammation against harmless microbiota. At the same time, a balanced mix of lower- and higher-inflammatory microbial species keeps immune cells appropriately primed to respond rapidly to invading pathogens without triggering chronic inflammation. Through the common mucosal immune system and the gut–lung axis, gut microbes further influence respiratory immunity, demonstrating systemic immune cross-talk. Early-life microbial exposure is especially important, as proper colonization during infancy and pregnancy-associated immune modulation are linked to reduced risk of allergic diseases such as asthma. Overall, the upper respiratory tract protects against infection via maintaining controlled immune responsiveness while also fostering a native microbiome.</p>

      <p>The mucociliary elevator involves ciliated epithelial cells that create work with the mucus created by goblet cells, serous cells, and submucosal glands. Goblet cells, serous cells, and bronchial glands release mucus that captures particles and microbes. This mucus layer is then transported upwards and outwards through the beating of the cilia. Mucus is then expelled from the respiratory tract through swallowing (enters GI tract), coughing, or sneezing. This process prevents antigens from entering the lungs and clears debris/dead cells. The most mucus is created in the trachea, with a moderate amount synthesized in the bronchi/bronchioles, and none in the alveoli.</p>

      <p>Secreted molecules in the upper respiratory tract (URT) provide a coordinated antimicrobial defense derived from epithelial cells, salivary glands, immune cells, and plasma exudate. Airway epithelial cells and submucosal glands produce antimicrobial peptides such as α- and β-defensins and the cathelicidin (LL-37), which are cationic molecules that disrupt negatively charged microbial membranes and also modulate chemotaxis and cytokine signaling. Histatins, produced primarily by the parotid and submandibular salivary glands, contribute antifungal and antibacterial activity within the oral cavity and nasopharynx. Several key enzymes are secreted locally: lysozyme, made by epithelial cells, submucosal glands, and neutrophils, cleaves peptidoglycan in bacterial cell walls. Phospholipase A2, derived from epithelial cells and inflammatory cells, hydrolyzes bacterial membrane phospholipids. Lactoperoxidase and other peroxidases, produced by airway glands and neutrophils, generate reactive antimicrobial compounds. Lactoferrin, released from epithelial cells, serous glands, and neutrophil secondary granules, sequesters iron to inhibit microbial growth and can directly damage microbial membranes. Additional contributors include secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) from epithelial cells, mucins from goblet cells that trap microbes in mucus, and complement proteins that reach the mucosa through plasma transudation during inflammation. On the adaptive side, secretory IgA (the most dominant immunoglobulin in secretions like mucus), produced by plasma cells in the lamina propria and transported across epithelial cells via the polymeric Ig receptor, predominates at mucosal surfaces and neutralizes pathogens without provoking excessive inflammation. IgM, also produced by plasma cells, is secreted in pentameric form and efficiently activates complement during early immune responses. Together, these substances create a robust antimicrobial barrier that kills or neutralizes pathogens, regulates inflammation, and maintains immune homeostasis in the upper respiratory tract.</p>
  
      <p>Pulmonary surfactant is produced by type II pneumocytes and consists of phospholipids and specialized surfactant proteins with both biophysical and immunologic functions. The hydrophobic proteins SP-B and SP-C, synthesized and secreted by type II pneumocytes from lamellar bodies, are primarily responsible for lowering alveolar surface tension and preventing collapse. They do not play a major role in host defense. In contrast, SP-A and SP-D are hydrophilic, collagen-containing C-type lectins (collectins) that contribute significantly to innate immunity. SP-A, the most abundant surfactant protein in the lungs, binds carbohydrate structures on microbial surfaces and interacts with receptors on alveolar macrophages, promoting opsonization, enhancing phagocytosis, activating macrophages, permeabilizing microbial membranes, and in some cases contributing to microbial killing through reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. SP-D, structurally similar but functionally broader in pathogen recognition, opsonizes a wider variety of microbes in a manner analogous to mannose-binding lectin and also exerts anti-inflammatory effects by modulating immune cell signaling and decreasing proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF.</p>

      <p>In the lungs, mucosal antibody immunity is dominated by polymeric IgA, primarily in dimeric form joined tail-to-tail by a J chain. IgA is produced by activated B cells/plasma cells located in the submucosa and interstitial spaces of the respiratory tract. Soluble antigen from the airway lumen drains to the nearest lymph node or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (such as NALT or inducible bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue during infection), where B cells encounter antigen, receive T cell help, and undergo a germinal center reaction leading to affinity maturation and class switching. These activated B cells then enter the circulation and home back to mucosal sites, including the lungs, where they exit the bloodstream at high endothelial venules (HEVs), migrate through the interstitium, and differentiate into IgA-secreting plasma cells adjacent to the epithelium. The dimeric IgA they produce is transported across epithelial cells by the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), which specifically binds the J chain; during transcytosis, the receptor is cleaved, and its extracellular portion remains attached to IgA, forming secretory IgA that is released into the airway lumen. Notably, pIgR expression is lower in the respiratory tract than in the gastrointestinal tract. The predominant subclass in the lungs is IgA1 (in contrast to IgA2 in the gut). IgM can also be transported via pIgR but is present at much lower levels in the respiratory tract than IgA. In contrast, IgG and IgE reach the airways primarily through passive diffusion across epithelial tight junctions rather than active transport. Together, this system enables antigen-specific, affinity-matured IgA responses that neutralize pathogens at the mucosal surface.</p>

      <p>The respiratory epithelium forms a tightly regulated physical and immunologic barrier that protects against inhaled pathogens and particles. Epithelial cells are joined by tight junctions that maintain barrier integrity while allowing selective immune communication. Ciliated cells coordinate mucociliary clearance by moving mucus upward toward the mouth, mechanically removing trapped microbes. Goblet cells produce mucus that traps pathogens and particulate matter, while neuroendocrine cells, though rare, respond to lung injury and help mediate repair and local signaling. In the distal airways, club cells (formerly known as Clara cells) serve as secretory cells in the bronchioles, primarily at bifurcation points and the bronchiole-alveolar ducts, and contribute to detoxification of foreign substances. Type II pneumocytes secrete surfactant to reduce surface tension and can also function as antigen-presenting cells (APCs), linking barrier defense with immune activation. M cells are uncommon in most of the respiratory tract and are primarily found in the follicle-associated epithelium of the upper airways. Epithelial cells may rarely differentiate into M cells to facilitate antigen sampling.</p>

      <p>Within the upper airway, nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) is a structured mucosal immune site located adjacent to epithelial surfaces. Unlike typical respiratory epithelium, NALT contains fewer goblet cells and less mucus coverage, allowing greater antigen access. It is heavily infiltrated with lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells and is enriched with microfold (M) cells, which specialize in transporting luminal antigen to underlying immune cells. Humans possess constitutive NALT, serving as a constant immune surveillance site, whereas bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) is not normally present. Instead, BALT is an inducible lymphoid aggregate that forms in the lower respiratory tract during severe or chronic infection, reflecting an adaptive expansion of mucosal immunity in response to inflammatory stimuli.</p>

      <p>In healthy lungs, alveolar macrophages reside within the alveolar spaces as the dominant immune cell population, where they ingest and degrade inhaled antigens, clear excess pulmonary surfactant, remove apoptotic cells and debris, and suppress inappropriate immune activation to maintain homeostasis. These macrophages originate from the embryonic yolk sac and are largely self-renewing rather than continuously replenished from circulating monocytes. Functionally, alveolar macrophages are highly phagocytic but relatively poor at antigen presentation, prioritizing clearance over T cell activation. In contrast, interstitial macrophages, located within the alveolar interstitium (not the airway lumen), are hematopoietic stem cell-derived, less phagocytic, and more efficient at presenting antigen to T cells, contributing more prominently to the overall inflammatory response. Together, these populations balance effective microbial removal with restraint of unnecessary inflammation. A central theme of pulmonary immunity is to avoid responses to innocuous airborne antigens while remaining prepared for pathogens.</p>

      <p>Antigen that crosses the epithelium is typically cleared by macrophages and is poorly presented to T cells. Non-threatening antigens fail to activate dendritic cells (DCs), resulting in low DC stimulation and limited T cell priming. Instead, airway DCs often adopt a regulatory phenotype, producing IL-10 and TGF-β and promoting the differentiation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) rather than effector T helper cells. These Tregs migrate back to the mucosa and actively suppress APCs, B cells, and antigen-specific T cells, reinforcing mucosal tolerance. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) help determine whether tolerance or immunity develops, tipping the balance toward inflammation when true infection is present. Coating microbes with IgA further limits inflammatory signaling. Through this coordinated system the lung maintains local and even systemic mucosal tolerance while preserving the capacity for rapid immune activation when needed.</p>
  
      <h2 id="infectious-cough">Infectious Cough Diseases</h2>
      <p>Infectious cough is primarily a symptom of bronchitis, laryngotracheobronchitis (croup), or pertussis. Infectious causes can vary by age group, anatomic location, and pathogen, and may produce either dry or wet cough depending on the degree of mucus production and lower airway involvement. It is paramount to review the major infectious causes of cough, distinguish characteristic cough patterns and associated findings, and identify common causative organisms.</p>
   
      <p>Bronchitis is the inflammation of medium-to-large sized airways without the presence of pneumonia. Its symptoms are non-productive cough, rhinitis, fever, malaise (fatigue), and sore throat. Bronchitis can be caused by a wide variety of microbes and viruses: Influenza, Coronavirus, Rhinovirus, Reovirus, Adenovirus, Enteroviruses, Measles, HPV (6 + 11), Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis. Respiratory infection triggers the release of inflammatory cytokines that drive airway inflammation. This inflammatory response causes mucosal edema, increased mucus production, and impaired mucociliary clearance, all of which heighten cough reflex sensitivity and contribute to sputum formation. Irritation of airway cough receptors leads to a persistent cough that can last for up to three weeks. Inflammation also produces transient bronchial hyperresponsiveness, resulting in wheezing and rhonchi on examination. Even after clearance, the cough may persist due to ongoing airway inflammation, residual hyperreactivity, and sustained sensitization of the cough reflex.</p>
 
      <p>Laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) is most common among children. Common symptoms of croup are coryza, rhinorrhea, pharyngitis, fever, raspy (seal-like) barking cough, stridor, dyspnea, and respiratory distress. Croup is most commonly caused by Parainfluenza virus and can also be caused by Influenza and coronaviruses. It will commonly present with "steeple sign" on X-Ray. Parainfluenza infection of the nasopharyngeal and tracheal epithelium triggers an inflammatory response that leads to airway edema and increased mucus production. As inflammation extends from the larynx into the subglottic region, edema narrows the airway lumen. This narrowing increases airflow resistance, and turbulent air movement across the constricted subglottis produces the characteristic inspiratory stridor and "barking" cough. Crying or agitation further increases agitation, which amplifies turbulence and dynamic airway obstruction, thereby worsening the present stridor.</p>

      <p>Pertussis, or whooping cough, is caused by the Gram-negative coccobacillus Bordetella pertussis, which infects the respiratory tract through a toxin-mediated, surface-level infection of the tracheal and bronchial epithelium. The bacteria adhere to ciliated epithelial cells via adhesins, allowing colonization without deep tissue invasion. Disease manifestations are largely toxin-driven: tracheal cytotoxin (TCT) damages ciliated epithelial cells and impairs mucociliary clearance, leading to mucus accumulation, while pertussis toxin (PT) inactivates Gi proteins, increasing intracellular cAMP which prevents lymphocytes from migrating out of the bloodstream into lymphoid tissues. Clinically, pertussis progresses through three stages: catarrhal, paroxysmal, and convalescent. The catarrhal phase resembles a mild upper respiratory infection with rhinorrhea, low-grade fever, and dry cough as bacterial proliferation and toxin production begin. The paroxysmal phase is marked by severe, repetitive coughing spasms due to mucus buildup and impaired clearance; the classic "whoop" occurs when a forceful inspiration follows a prolonged coughing fit through a partially closed glottis. During the convalescent phase, bacteria are cleared and epithelial repair begins, but cough may persist for weeks due to delayed restoration of ciliary function and residual airway hypersensitivity.</p>

      <h2 id="pneumonia">Pneumonia</h2>
      <p>Pneumonia is any infection of the lung parenchyma. It is classified by etiology, location of acquisition (community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and the historical term healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP)), clinical features, and host factors. A comprehensive understanding of pneumonia requires knowledge of typical and atypical pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, as well as their defining characteristics, clinical presentations, and diagnostic approaches. The causative organisms vary according to setting and patient population, with Streptococcus pneumoniae being the most common cause of CAP, gram-negative bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus frequently implicated in HAP, and opportunistic pathogens such as Pneumocystis jirovecii, Aspergillus fumigatus, CMV, and encapsulated bacteria specifically affecting immunocompromised individuals. Host immune status plays a critical role in susceptibility and disease manifestation, particularly in patients with HIV or other forms of immunosuppression, in whom opportunistic infections and atypical presentations are more common. Developing a differential diagnosis for both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients requires integrating epidemiologic exposure, immune function, and characteristic clinical and radiologic patterns to guide appropriate evaluation and treatment.</p>
      
      <p>It is also imperative to establish the differences between lobar pneumonia and bronchopneumonia. Lobar pneumonia involves uniform consolidation of a lobe of a lung (or even the entire lung!) and is characterized by inflammatory intra-alveolar exudate that progresses through four classic stages: congestion, red hepatization, gray hepatization, and resolution. It is most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, although Legionella, Klebsiella, and Haemophilus influenzae may also be responsible. Clinically, it presents with sudden onset of high fever, chills, productive cough with purulent sputum, pleuritic chest pain, crackles, bronchial breath sounds, and dullness to percussion. In contrast, bronchopneumonia primarily affects the bronchioles and adjacent alveoli and demonstrates a patchy distribution that may involve multiple lobes, often the lower lobes or right middle lobe. It is commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella. Although the clinical features are similar to those of lobar pneumonia, the radiologic and pathologic pattern is patchy rather than uniformly lobar, and it does not follow the same classic staged progression seen in lobar pneumonia.</p>

      <h3>Bacterial Pneumonia Pathogenesis</h3>
      <p>Bacteria are introduced through respiration or begin by colonizing the nasopharynx. Bacteria typically have a virulence factor that allows them to evade the immune system. Alveolar macrophages initiate an inflammatory response (IL-1, IL-6 TNF-alpha) in an attempt to neutralize the bacteria, leading to neutrophil recruitment, tissue damage, and vascular leakage into the alveoli. The toxins generated by the bacteria damage the epithelium and introduce further inflammation that disrupts the alveolar-capillary barrier. The alveoli are filled with plasma proteins, immune cells, bacteria, and toxins. Gas transport and alveolar constriction occurs in the afflicted area, leading to decreased gas transport and alveolar consolidation (hepatization), therefore pulmonary shunting occurs.</p>
    
      <p>Hepatization refers to the pathological transformation of consolidated lung tissue during pneumonia due to inflammatory exudate. In histology, it begins to look more liver-like, hence the name. Increased egophony and tactile fremitus occur due to consolidation. There are four stages of lobar pneumonia to know: congestion, red hepatization, gray hepatization, and resolution. Congestion refers to the primary inflammation, and occurs 1-2 days after initial infection. Alveoli fill with exudate and infective organisms, there are little neutrophils and RBCs, and vasculature becomes leaky. The red hepatization phase occurs at days 3-4 and appears on gross morphology as a firm, red appearance. Neutrophils, RBCs, and fibrin collect in the consolidation; it appears red due to the RBCs and congestion. Enzymatic breakdown of RBCs leads to the rust- colored sputum coughed up. The gray hepatization phase occurs days 5-7; RBCs break down, neutrophils begin to die, and fibrin and leukocyte debris persists, producing a gray, solid lung. Resolution occurs at day 8; macrophages clear exudate, cough and mucociliary clearance help clear debris, pneumocytes repopulate (courtesy of type II), and lung compliance gradually returns.</p>

      <h3>Viral Pneumonia Pathogenesis</h3>
      <p>Viruses are introduced through respiration and can infect both ciliated cells and Type II pneumocytes. Epithelial cells initiate interferon-based antiviral responses (recruitment of CD8+ T cells and epithelial cell death via apoptosis). Disruption of the epithelial barrier leads to edema and protein leakage into the alveoli, decreased mucociliary clearance due to loss of ciliated cells, and impaired gas exchange. Depending on location (and types of cells infected) there can be interstitial thickening (loss of compliance), diffuse alveolar damage, and atelectasis (alveolar collapse) from surfactant depletion. Interstitial thickening leads to a decreased DLCO without filling the alveoli with fluid. This is known as an "atypical" presentation of pneumonia (dry cough, "walking" pneumonia).</p>

      <h3>Opportunistic Pneumonia</h3>
      <p>Pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals is associated with a broader spectrum of pathogens and often more severe or atypical presentations compared to immunocompetent patients. In addition to common bacterial causes such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and gram-negative bacteria, immunocompromised patients are particularly susceptible to opportunistic organisms. Clinical presentation may resemble typical bacterial pneumonia with acute high fever and pleural effusion, but atypical features such as nonproductive cough, diffuse bilateral infiltrates, and subacute progression are also common. Careful consideration of immune status, risk factors, and exposure history is essential in guiding the differential diagnosis and management of pneumonia in these types of patients.</p>
     
      <p>Common opportunistic microbes know and look out for (bacteria): E.coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, MAC complex, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Coxiella burnetii. Viruses: Cytomegalovirus, Herpesvirus, and Influenza. Fungi: Pneumocysitis jirovecii, Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., Cryptococcus neoformans.</p>
 
      <h3>Aspiration Pneumonia</h3>
      <p>Risk factors of aspiration pneumonia are: impaired swallowing, reduced cough reflexes, or loss of consciousness (commonly due to alcohol or anesthesia) leading to potential aspiration of oropharyngeal flora. This typically occurs in the lower lobe of the right lung. Oropharyngeal microbes (a mix of aerobic and anaerobic microbes) are introduced through aspiration and fail to be cleared (a large aspiration of microbes overwhelms the immune defenses) leading to colonization of the lower airways. Gradually, the microbes outcompete the noninflammatory immune responses resulting in edema, leukocyte infiltration, and inflammation. As the lungs are continually reinfected through aspiration, the inflammatory response remains on-going. This can potentially lead to a lung abscess.</p>
      
      <p>A lung abscess is a pus-filled, necrotic cavity in the lung parenchyma. As the lungs are continually reseeded with bacteria through aspiration, the inflammatory response remains on-going. Anaerobic bacteria cause tissue necrosis through proteolytic enzymes, leading to liquefactive necrosis (a softening and liquefaction of tissue due to the release of hydrolytic enzymes that break down connective tissue and cells). Necrotic tissue is walled off by a fibrous capsule that fills with pus and debris. If the cavity erodes into a bronchus, air enters the cavity, making a visible meniscus (the top of a fluid where it meets the air) visible on imaging. Persistent inflammation leads to systemic symptoms typical of pneumonia.</p>
 
      <h2 id="tuberculosis">Tuberculosis</h2>
      <p>Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a slender, branching microbe that can be visualized with an acid-fast (Ziehl-Neelsen) stain since its thick, waxy cell wall is rich with mycolic acids. This is also why it cannot be visualized on gram stain. It grows on Lowenstein-Jensen agar very slowly, so culturing sputum/lavage is not great for diagnostic purposes. It is an obligate aerobe, is non motile, and does not form spores.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">

          <figcaption>Mycobacterium tuberculosis Ziehl-Neelsen Stain</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>Mtb starts by first entering macrophages via phagocytosis. When within the macrophage, Mtb inhibits phagosome maturation by blocking phagosome-lysosome fusion and vessel acidification. Mtb replicates, enters the vasculature, and seeds at multiple sites. Mtb enters the lymphatics, leading to the hilar lymph nodes, and is taken by the lymph to the thoracic duct where it enters the circulation; the right side of heart pumps Mtb through all parts of the lung and the left side of heart pumps Mtb throughout the rest of the body. The most frequent sites for secondary (reactivation) TB later in life are the apical posterior segments of the upper lobes due to their highly oxygenated environment.</p>
    
      <p>As infection progresses, Th1 cells are generated and enter the lungs. Activated macrophages and Th1s form granulomas. A granuloma begins as an exudative granuloma and may either heal (become a productive/proliferative granuloma that successfully contains TB) or become necrotic (liquefies and becomes a cavitation). Primary TB initially begins with caseous focuses in the lower part of the upper lobes or upper part of the lower lobes. Reseeding typically occurs in the apices of the lungs (usually the apical posterior lobe) as part of primary tuberculosis.</p>

      </div>
      <h3>Primary vs Secondary TB</h3>
      <p>As mentioned above, primary tuberculosis (TB) occurs following first-time exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. After inhalation, bacilli reach the terminal alveoli and replicate within alveolar macrophages. An effective cell-mediated (Th1) immune response develops after approximately 2-3 weeks, leading to macrophage activation and granuloma formation. The characteristic lesion is the Ghon focus, typically located in the middle or lower lung lobes, which together with regional lymph node involvement forms the Ghon complex. In most immunocompetent individuals, primary TB is asymptomatic or causes only mild symptoms, and infection is contained through granuloma formation. However, before immune containment, there may be lymphatic and multisystem dissemination, potentially seeding Mtb in multiple organs. This is especially true in individuals with impaired immunity; failure of granuloma containment can result in progressive primary TB.</p>
       <div class="figure-row">

          <figcaption>TB Diagram</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>Secondary (reactivation) tuberculosis develops due to reactivation of latent infection or reinfection, typically in the setting of weakened immunity. Because the host is previously sensitized to mycobacterial antigens, the immune response is more intense, resulting in extensive tissue destruction, caseating granulomas, cavitation, and scarring. Secondary TB most commonly affects the upper lobes (apical regions) of the lungs. Unlike primary TB, secondary TB is typically symptomatic and contagious, presenting with productive cough and constitutional symptoms such as fever, fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss. Hemoptysis may occur with progressive cavitary disease, and pleuritic chest pain suggests extension of inflammation to the pleura. Secondary TB can also involve extrapulmonary sites, reflecting prior hematogenous seeding during the primary infection.</p>
      <div class="figure-row">

          <figcaption>TB cavitation in right upper lobe.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>To summarize: Primary TB has the innate immune phase (1-2 weeks) in which Mtb is phagocytized and seeded, the cell-mediated immune phase (3-4 weeks) in which granuloma formation occurs via interferon gamma, and the granuloma formation/containment phase in which Ghon complexes form. Primary TB leads to either proper containment (fibrosis and containment, otherwise known as a Ranke complex) or progressive primary TB. Secondary TB has the latent phase, the reactivation phase (triggered by immune suppression) in which breakdown of granulomas and renewed bacterial replication occurs, and the progressive/destructive phase, in which the formation of caseating granulomas occurs with central necrosis and Langhans giant cells.</p>

      <h2 id="extra-microbes">Extra Microbes</h2>
      <h3>Escherichia Coli</h3>
      <p>E. Coli is a gram negative (stains pink on gram stain) rod that grows pink on MacConkey agar. It is a facultative anaerobe, can be citrate positive, and is normally seen in the gut microbiome. It can cause pneumonia, particularly in newborns. It may also cause pulmonary infections when intestinal flora spread to other organs or in vulnerable populations. Like other gram-negative bacilli, E. coli possesses lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin, which can contribute to systemic inflammation and septic shock in severe infections. Its role in respiratory disease is most clinically relevant in neonates.</p>

      <h3>Klebsiella pneumoniae</h3>
      <p>K. pneumoniae is a gram-negative bacillus in the Enterobacteriaceae family characterized by a prominent mucoid capsule, which contributes to its virulence and resistance to phagocytosis. It is a lactose fermenter, forming pink colonies on MacConkey agar, is non-motile, and is citrate positive. In the respiratory context, it is an important cause of aspiration pneumonia and lung abscess, particularly in individuals with alcohol use disorder or diabetes, and is classically associated with thick, mucoid, blood-tinged "currant jelly" sputum. Its large polysaccharide capsule and potential for multidrug resistance contribute to severe, necrotizing pulmonary infections.</p>

      <h3>Legionella pneumonia</h3>
      <p>Legionella is a gram-negative, aerobic, intracellular rod that is difficult to gram stain, requiring a silver stain to properly visualize. It is cultured on charcoal-yeast media with iron and cysteine, and is motile. It is transmitted via contaminated, aspirated water droplets. It causes Legionnaires' disease, a form of atypical pneumonia characterized by fever, dry cough (which may progress to productive), dyspnea, bilateral crackles, and prominent extrapulmonary features including diarrhea and neurological symptoms (confusion); relative bradycardia may also be seen. High-risk groups include older adults, smokers, individuals with chronic disease, and the immunocompromised. A milder form, Pontiac fever, presents as a flu-like illness without pneumonia.</p>

      <h3>Mycobacterium Avium intracellulare complex</h3>
      <p>The Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) consists of M. avium and M. intracellulare. This microbe is an important cause of opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, especially those with advanced HIV (CD4+ < 50). MAC organisms are acid-fast, slender bacilli that may appear in straight or branching chains on staining and possess a waxy cell wall rich in mycolic acids, which prevents Gram staining and contributes to acid-fastness; they require a Ziehl-Neelsen (acid-fast) stain to visualize. They are aerobic, do not form spores, and are non-motile. Infection occurs via the respiratory or gastrointestinal epithelium and may remain localized or become disseminated, presenting with fever, night sweats, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and pulmonary findings; diagnosis is confirmed by isolation of acid-fast bacilli on culture.</p>

      <p>Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an aerobic, acid-fast, slender bacillus that may appear in straight or serpentine (cord-like) arrangements on staining (Ziehl-Neelsen). It has a waxy cell wall rich in mycolic acids, which prevents Gram staining and contributes to its acid-fast properties. It is aerobic, does not form spores, is non-motile, and cultures on Löwenstein-Jensen agar (agar with egg yolk) which takes several weeks. Clinically, it causes tuberculosis, a pulmonary infection that may present with chronic cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and cavitary upper-lobe lesions in reactivation disease.</p>

      <h3>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</h3>
      <p>Pseudomonas is a gram-negative rod that is aerobic, motile, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, and does not form spores. It is a non-lactose fermenter and is classically associated with beta hemolysis on blood agar, a characteristic blue-green pigment (pyocyanin) that can produce blue-green pus, and a distinctive sweet, fruity (grape-like) odor in culture. This microbe is an opportunistic pathogen with intrinsic and acquired multidrug resistance. It commonly causes nosocomial pneumonia, chronic pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis, wound infections, UTIs, and sepsis.</p>

      <h3>Cytomegalovirus (HHV-5)</h3>
      <p>CMV is a Herpesvirus with a dsDNA genome, icosahedral capsid, tegument (protein layer located between the capsid and the envelope), and envelope. Herpesvirus establishes lifelong latency after primary infection, with potential for later reactivation. Infection is usually asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals. Severe disease primarily occurs in immunocompromised patients (HIV/AIDS with CD4+ < 50 or transplant recipients) and may manifest as CMV pneumonia (interstitial pneumonitis with diffuse bilateral infiltrates), CMV retinitis (classic "pizza-pie" appearance on fundoscopy with retinal hemorrhages and white opacities), esophagitis/colitis (linear ulcers), hepatitis, encephalitis, or adrenal insufficiency. Diagnosis relies on serology or direct viral detection (PCR or antigen testing), and treatment for severe disease includes ganciclovir or valganciclovir.</p>

      <h3>Measles Virus (Rubeola)</h3>
      <p>Measles is from the family paramyxovirus and is an enveloped, highly-contagious, negative sense ssRNA virus. It has a helical nucleocapsid and surface fusion proteins that facilitate infection of respiratory epithelial cells and promote cell-to-cell spread. Measles is transmitted primarily via airborne droplets; after inhalation, the virus spreads to local lymph nodes and then hematogenously. Clinically, it progresses through a prodrome (fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, Koplik spots), followed by a descending maculopapular rash. Vaccination with the live-attenuated MMR vaccine provides effective prevention.</p>

      <h3>COVID-19</h3>
      <p>Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is from the family Coronaviridae and has a positive-sense ssRNA genome. It is enveloped, causes COVID-19, and is most notable for its Spike protein. The Spike (S) protein is a surface glycoprotein embedded in the viral envelope that facilitates viral entry by binding to the ACE2 receptor on host cells. After binding, the spike protein is activated by TMPRSS2, allowing membrane fusion and entry of viral RNA into the host cell. The term "corona" refers to the crown-like appearance of the virus on electron microscopy. This appearance is created by the prominent spike (S) glycoproteins projecting outward from the viral envelope, forming a halo or crown around the virion.</p>

      <p>Aspergillus is a mold that grows as hyphae with septate (partitions between cells) dichomatous branching on histopathology. It is typically identified using a silver stain or PAS stain, which highlights the fungal cell wall. The organism produces airborne conidia (spores) that are classically arranged in columnar formations. Aspergillus causes a spectrum of disease ranging from allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) to chronic pulmonary aspergillosis and invasive aspergillosis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.</p>

      <p>Pneumocystis jirovecii is an opportunistic fungus that causes Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), primarily in the immunocompromised, especially those with HIV/AIDS and CD4+ counts < 200. It exists in two major growth forms: a trophic form, which attaches to type I pneumocytes in the alveoli, and a cyst form. On microscopy, the cysts appear disc-shaped (cup-shaped) with central dark, spore-like dots and are best visualized using a silver stain. Unlike many fungi, P. jirovecii lacks ergosterol in its cell membrane, which is clinically relevant for therapy. Patients typically present with fever, exertional dyspnea, nonproductive cough, and hypoxemia, and imaging often shows diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities. Treatment and prophylaxis of choice is high-dose TMP-SMX (Bactrim).</p>

      <h3>Beta 2 Agonists</h3>
      <p>Beta 2 agonists (-terol, -uterol if SABA) are bronchodilators that selectively stimulate beta 2 adrenergic receptors, leading to relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. They are classified based on duration of action into short-acting B2 agonists (SABAs) and long-acting B2 agonists (LABAs). SABAs, such as albuterol and levalbuterol (-uterol), have a rapid onset of action (1-5 minutes) and a duration of 4-6 hours (levalbuterol up to 8 hours), making them suitable for quick symptom relief. LABAs, including formoterol and salmeterol (-terol), have a prolonged duration of action (over 12 hours); formoterol has a rapid onset (1-5 minutes), whereas salmeterol has a delayed onset (30-45 minutes). Adverse effects include tachycardia and other cardiac arrhythmias, tremor, anxiety, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia (due to intracellular potassium shift), and tolerance may develop. Paradoxical bronchospasm can also occur.</p>

      <h3>Corticosteroids</h3>
      <p>Corticosteroids (-sone or -sonide) are indicated for long-term control of inflammatory airway diseases such as asthma. Inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone, budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone) act locally in the airways and provide direct anti-inflammatory effects while minimizing systemic adverse effects. Glucocorticoids exert their effects through inhibition of both phospholipase A2 and inflammatory genomic mechanisms (NF-KB, a transcription factor that upregulates proinflammatory genes that code for cytokines) that suppress inflammatory responses and immune activity. Inhaled corticosteroids primarily act at the site of administration, with only partial systemic absorption. A common local adverse effect of inhaled corticosteroids is oropharyngeal candidiasis, which can be reduced by rinsing the mouth after inhalation or using a spacer.</p>

      <h3>Leukotriene Modifiers</h3>
      <p>Leukotriene modifiers include the drugs zileuton, montelukast, and zafirlukast (-lukast). When arachidonic acid becomes phospholipase A2, it then becomes either prostaglandins, prostacyclins, or thromboxane A2 via the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway in most cells. In leukocytes, phospholipase A2 primarily becomes leukotrienes via the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway (AA -> 5-HPETE -> Leukotrienes). Leukotrienes cause neutrophil chemotaxis, capillary permeability, and bronchoconstriction. Zileuton directly inhibits the LOX enzyme, while the -lukast drugs bind leukotriene receptors (leukotriene receptor antagonists).</p>

      <h3>Cromolyn</h3>
      <p>Cromolyn (cromolyn sodium) is a mast cell stabilizer used as a controller medication in asthma. It works by preventing the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells, including histamine, thereby reducing airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction. It does not provide rapid bronchodilation. Cromolyn has a short duration of action, so it must be administered multiple times daily. Its routine use is now limited and it is no longer widely recommended.</p>

      <h3>Ipratropium</h3>
      <p>Ipratropium is a short-acting muscarinic antagonist (mainly for the M3 receptor, but also M1 and M2). It works by competitively inhibiting muscarinic receptors in the airways, thereby blocking the effects of acetylcholine. This results in bronchodilation and decreased bronchial secretions. It is used to treat COPD and asthma exacerbations, typically in combination with a SABA.</p>

      <h3>Theophylline</h3>
      <p>Theophylline is a nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor (PDEi) and a methylxanthine used in the treatment of asthma and severe, refractory COPD. Inhibiting PDE enzymes decreases the breakdown of cAMP, thereby increasing intracellular cAMP levels. This leads to relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle (bronchodilation) and inhibition of proinflammatory mediators. Theophylline also blocks adenosine receptors, contributing to its clinical effects and adverse reactions. Due to its narrow therapeutic index, serum drug monitoring is required. It is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system and has significant drug interaction potential. Adverse effects include tachycardia/arrhythmias, neurologic toxicity, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting.</p>
  
      <h3>Omalizumab</h3>
      <p>Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets unbound serum IgE. By binding circulating IgE, it prevents IgE from attaching to receptors on mast cells and basophils, thereby reducing activation of these cells and decreasing the release of inflammatory mediators involved in the allergic response. Omalizumab is administered subcutaneously and is notably expensive. Adverse effects include arthralgia, fatigue, dizziness, pruritus, and dermatitis, and there is a risk of anaphylaxis.</p>
      
      <h3>Tiotropium</h3>
      <p>Tiotropium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). LAMAs also include aclidinium, glycopyyrolate, revefenacin, and umeclidinium. It mainly targets the M3 receptor, but also can bind any muscarinic receptor. Indicated for COPD and asthma. Administered via either capsule or inhalation spray.</p>
  
      <h3>Roflumilast</h3>
      <p>Roflumilast is an oral PDE-4 inhibitor that decreases intracellular cAMP to reduce inflammation. Indicated for bronchitis. Can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headache.</p>
   
      <h3>H1 Antihistamines</h3>
      <p>H1 antihistamines exert their effects through competitive, reversible antagonism (or inverse agonism) of histamine H1 receptors, thereby reducing histamine-mediated symptoms such as increased vascular permeability, bronchoconstriction, mucus production, and pruritus. Because they competitively block receptor activation rather than histamine release, they are generally more effective for prevention of allergic symptoms than for treating severe reactions with high histamine levels.</p>

      <h3>Drugs Indicated for Cough</h3>
      <p>Opioids such as codeine act centrally to suppress the cough reflex at the CNS and carry a risk of sedation, constipation, and addictive potential; therefore, they should be avoided in patients at risk for substance use disorders. Dextromethorphan, a synthetic derivative with central antitussive effects, has a lower addictive potential but may cause dizziness, nausea, and, in overdose, altered mental status or hallucinations. Guaifenesin is an expectorant used for productive cough; it increases bronchial fluid to reduce mucus viscosity and is often combined with codeine or dextromethorphan. Benzonatate is a peripherally acting antitussive that anesthetizes respiratory stretch receptors to suppress the cough reflex; adverse effects include nausea, dizziness, and neurologic symptoms in overdose. N-acetylcysteine (acetylcysteine) is a mucolytic that reduces sputum viscosity by breaking disulfide bonds in mucoproteins and is also used as an antidote for acetaminophen overdose by restoring hepatic glutathione. Dornase alfa, a recombinant human DNase, decreases sputum viscosity by cleaving extracellular DNA in purulent secretions. It should be avoided in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis because it may increase exacerbations.</p>

      <h3>Drugs Indicated for TB</h3>
      <p>Rifampin, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol (RIP THAM) are indicated for treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Rifampin is a rifamycin that blocks RNA transcription by binding to RNA polymerase. It distributes to all body fluids and organs and is a CYP450 inducer, which means that it causes all sorts of drug-drug reactions. Adverse effects are hepatotoxicity, flu-like syndrome, and harmless orange-red urine discoloration. Isonazid is a prodrug that inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acid, disrupting cell wall synthesis. It is a CYP450 inhibitor and also causes neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and drug-induced lupus. Pyrazinamide has an unknown MOA. It distributes throughout the entire body and causes hepatotoxicity and uric acid retention. Ethambutol inhibits arabinosyl transferase which is an enzyme needed for synthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall. May also cause optic neuritis and uric acid retention.</p>

      <h3>Antivirals</h3>
      <p>Neuraminidase inhibitors (-amivir) are antiviral agents used for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A and B. Common agents include oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir. They act by inhibiting viral neuraminidase, an enzyme responsible for cleaving newly formed virions from the surface of infected host cells. By blocking this step, neuraminidase inhibitors prevent the release and spread of progeny viruses, thereby limiting viral replication. These agents are most effective when initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset, reducing the duration and severity of illness. Oseltamivir is applied orally and the preferred agent in hospitalized patients and in children with influenza A or B. Common adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, headache, and upper respiratory symptoms.</p>
  
      <p>Ribavirin is an inhibitor of RNA polymerase. It works by competitively, directly inhibiting IMP dehydrogenase which decreases the synthesis of guanine nucleotides. It is indicated for RSV Bronchiolitis and Hep C. One major adverse effect of Ribavirin is its accumulation in RBCs leading to anemia. It is also teratogenic (contraindicated in pregnancy). Similarly, Remdesivir is an adenosine analog that inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Its adverse effects include hepatotoxicity, anemia, and hyperglycemia.</p>

      <p>Baloxavir marboxil (brand name: Xofluza) is an antiviral agent used for the treatment of influenza A and B. It inhibits viral RNA transcription and thereby decreases viral replication. It is indicated for acute, uncomplicated influenza and is most effective when started within 48 hours of symptom onset. Due to its long half-life, it is administered as a single oral dose. Common adverse effects include nausea, diarrhea, bronchitis, and headache.</p>
